<h1 id="executive_summary"><span>1. </span>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>Over 100 separate source files are concatenated into a
single large files of C-code named "sqlite3.c" and
called "the amalgamation". The amalgamation
contains everything an application needs to embed SQLite.
The amalgamation file is more than 220,000 lines long and over 7.5
megabytes in size (as of 2018-11-24).

</p><p>Combining all the code for SQLite into one big file makes SQLite
easier to deploy &mdash; there is just one file to keep track of.  
And because all code is in
a single translation unit, compilers can do better inter-procedure
optimization resulting in machine code that is between 5% and 10% faster.

</p><h1 id="the_sqlite_amalgamation"><span>2. </span>The SQLite Amalgamation</h1>

<p>The SQLite library consists of 102 files of C code
(as of <a href="releaselog/3_9_0.html">Version 3.9.0</a> - 2015-10-14)
in the core with 32 additional files that
implement the <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a>, <a href="fts5.html">FTS5</a>, <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a>, <a href="dbstat.html">DBSTAT</a>, <a href="json1.html">JSON1</a>, and
<a href="rbu.html">RBU</a> extensions.
Of the 102 
main source files, about 75% are C code and about 25% are C header files.
Most of these are "source" files in the sense that they are stored 
in the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src">SQLite version control system</a>
and are edited manually in an ordinary text editor.
But some of the C-language files are generated using scripts
or auxiliary programs.  For example, the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact?ci=trunk&filename=src/parse.y">parse.y</a>
file contains an LALR(1) grammar of the SQL language which is compiled
down into are parser in files "parse.c" and "parse.h" by the
<a href="lemon.html">Lemon parser generator</a>.
</p>

<p>The makefiles for SQLite have an "sqlite3.c" target for building the
file we call "the amalgamation".
The amalgamation is a single C code file, named "sqlite3.c",
that contains all C code 
for the core SQLite library and the <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a>, <a href="fts5.html">FTS5</a>, <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a>,
<a href="dbstat.html">DBSTAT</a>, <a href="json1.html">JSON1</a>, and <a href="rbu.html">RBU</a> extensions.
This file contains about 184K lines of code 
(113K if you omit blank lines and comments) and is over 6.4 megabytes
in size.
Though the various extensions are included in the
"sqlite3.c" amalgamation file, they are disabled using #ifdef statements.
Activate the extensions using <a href="compile.html">compile-time options</a> like:

</p><ul>
<li> <a href="compile.html#enable_fts3">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3</a>
</li><li> <a href="compile.html#enable_fts5">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5</a>
</li><li> <a href="compile.html#enable_rtree">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE</a>
</li><li> <a href="compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB</a>
</li><li> <a href="compile.html#enable_json1">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1</a>
</li><li> <a href="compile.html#enable_rbu">-DSQLITE_ENABLE_RBU</a>
</li></ul>

<p>The amalgamation contains everything you need to integrate SQLite 
into a larger project.  Just copy the amalgamation into your source 
directory and compile it along with the other C code files in your project.
(A <a href="howtocompile.html">more detailed discussion</a> of the compilation process is
available.)
You may also want to make use of the "sqlite3.h" header file that 
defines the programming API for SQLite. 
The sqlite3.h header file is available separately. 
The sqlite3.h file is also contained within the amalgamation, in
the first few thousand lines. So if you have a copy of 
sqlite3.c but cannot seem to locate sqlite3.h, you can always 
regenerate the sqlite3.h by copying and pasting from the amalgamation.</p>

<p>In addition to making SQLite easier to incorporate into other
projects, the amalgamation also makes it run faster. Many
compilers are able to do additional optimizations on code when 
it is contained with in a single translation unit such as it 
is in the amalgamation. We have measured performance improvements
of between 5 and 10% when we use the amalgamation to compile 
SQLite rather than individual source files.  The downside of this
is that the additional optimizations often take the form of 
function inlining which tends to make the size of the resulting
binary image larger.</p>

<h1 id="the_split_amalgamation"><span>3. </span>The Split Amalgamation</h1>

<p>Developers sometimes experience trouble debugging the
185,000-line-long amalgamation source file because some debuggers
are only able to handle source code line numbers less than 32,768.
The amalgamation source code runs fine.  One just cannot single-step
through it in a debugger.

</p><p>To circumvent this limitation, the amalgamation is also available in
a split form, consisting of files "sqlite3-1.c", "sqlite3-2.c", and
so forth, where each file is less than 32,768 lines in length and
where the concatenation of the files contain all of the code for the
complete amalgamation.  Then there is a separate source file named
"sqlite3-all.c" which basically consists of code like this:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>#include "sqlite3-1.c"
#include "sqlite3-2.c"
#include "sqlite3-3.c"
#include "sqlite3-4.c"
#include "sqlite3-5.c"
#include "sqlite3-6.c"
#include "sqlite3-7.c"
</pre></div>

<p>Applications using the split amalgamation simply compile against
"sqlite3-all.c" instead of "sqlite3.c".  The two files work exactly
the same.  But with "sqlite3-all.c", no single source file contains more
than 32,767 lines of code, and so it is more convenient to use some
debuggers.  The downside of the split amalgamation is that it consists
of 6 C source code files instead of just 1.

</p><h1 id="download_copies_of_the_amalgamation"><span>4. </span>Download Copies Of The Amalgamation</h1>

<p>The amalgamation and
the sqlite3.h header file are available on
the <a href="download.html">download page</a> as a file 
named sqlite-amalgamation-X.zip
where the X is replaced by the appropriate version number.</p>

<a name="amalgbuild"></a>

<h1 id="building_the_amalgamation_from_canonical_source_code"><span>5. </span>Building The Amalgamation From Canonical Source Code</h1>

<p>To build the amalgamation (either the full amalgamation or the
split amalgamation), first
<a href="getthecode.html">get the canonical source code</a> from one of the three servers.
Then, on both unix-like systems and on Windows systems that have the
free <a href="http://mingw.org/wiki/msys">MinGW</a> development environment
installed, the amalgamation can be built using the
following commands:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>sh configure
make sqlite3.c
</pre></div>

<p>To build using Microsoft Visual C++, run this command:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>nmake /f makefile.msc sqlite3.c
</pre></div>

<p>In both cases, the split amalgamation can be obtained by
substituting "sqlite3-all.c" for "sqlite3.c" as the make target.

</p><h2 id="dependencies"><span>5.1. </span>Dependencies</h2>

<p>The build process makes extensive use of the 
<a href="http://www.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a> scripting language.  You will need to have a
copy of TCL installed in order for the make targets above to work.
Easy-to-use installers can be obtained from <a href="http://www.tcl-lang.org/">http://www.tcl-lang.org/</a>.
Many unix workstations have Tcl installed by default.
