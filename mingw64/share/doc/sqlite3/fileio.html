<h1 id=overview>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    SQLite stores an entire database within a single file, the format of
    which is described in the <i>SQLite File Database File Format</i> 
    document <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. Each database file is
    stored within a file system, presumably provided by the host operating
    system. Instead of interfacing with the operating system directly, 
    the host application is required to supply an adaptor component that 
    implements the <i>SQLite Virtual File System</i> interface 
    (described in <cite>capi_sqlitert_requirements</cite>). The adaptor
    component is responsible for translating the calls made by SQLite to
    the <i>VFS</i> interface into calls to the file-system interface 
    provided by the operating system. This arrangement is depicted in figure
    <cite>figure_vfs_role</cite>.
    <center><img src="images/fileformat/vfs_role.gif">
    <p><i>Figure <span class=fig id=figure_vfs_role></span> - Virtual File System (VFS) Adaptor</i>
      </center>
  <p>
    Although it would be easy to design a system that uses the <i>VFS</i>
    interface to read and update the content of a database file stored
    within a file-system, there are several complicated issues that need
    to be addressed by such a system:
  <ol>
    <li><p>SQLite is required to <b>implement atomic and durable
        transactions</b> (the 'A' and 'D' from the ACID acronym), even if an
        application, operating system or power failure occurs midway through or
        shortly after updating a database file.
        <p>To implement atomic transactions in the face of potential 
        application, operating system or power failures, database writers write
        a copy of those portions of the database file that they are going to
        modify into a second file, the <i>journal file</i>, before writing
        to the database file. If a failure does occur while modifying the 
        database file, SQLite can reconstruct the original database 
        (before the modifications were attempted) based on the contents of 
        the <i>journal file</i>.
    <li><p>SQLite is required to <b>implement isolated transactions</b> (the 'I'
        from the ACID acronym). 
        <p>This is done by using the file locking facilities provided by the
        VFS adaptor to serialize writers (write transactions) and preventing
        readers (read transactions) from accessing database files while writers
        are midway through updating them.
    <li><p>For performance reasons, it is advantageous to <b>minimize the 
        quantity of data read and written</b> to and from the file-system.
        <p>As one might expect, the amount of data read from the database 
        file is minimized by caching portions of the database file in main 
        memory. Additionally, multiple updates to the database file that
        are part of the same <i>write transaction</i> may be cached in
        main memory and written to the file together, allowing for
        more efficient IO patterns and eliminating the redundant write 
        operations that could take place if part of the database file is
        modified more than once within a single <i>write transaction</i>.
  </ol>
  <p class=todo>
    System requirement references for the above points.
  <p>
    This document describes in detail the way that SQLite uses the API 
    provided by the VFS adaptor component to solve the problems and implement
    the strategies enumerated above. It also specifies the assumptions made
    about the properties of the system that the VFS adaptor provides
    access to. For example, specific assumptions about the extent of
    data corruption that may occur if a power failure occurs while a
    database file is being updated are presented in section 
    <cite>fs_characteristics</cite>.
  <p>
    This document does not specify the details of the interface that must
    be implemented by the VFS adaptor component, that is left to
    <cite>capi_sqlitert_requirements</cite>.

  <h2>Document Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Section <cite>vfs_assumptions</cite> of this document describes the
      various assumptions made about the system to which the VFS adaptor
      component provides access. The basic capabilities and functions 
      required from the VFS implementation are presented along with the
      description of the VFS interface in 
      <cite>capi_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. Section
      <cite>vfs_assumptions</cite> complements this by describing in more
      detail the assumptions made about VFS implementations on which the
      algorithms presented in this document depend. Some of these assumptions
      relate to performance issues, but most concern the expected state of
      the file-system following a failure that occurs midway through 
      modifying a database file.
    <p>
      Section <cite>database_connections</cite> introduces the concept of
      a <i>database connection</i>, a combination of a file-handle and
      in-memory cache used to access a database file. It also describes the
      VFS operations required when a new <i>database connection</i> is
      created (opened), and when one is destroyed (closed).
    <p>
      Section <cite>reading_data</cite> describes the steps required to
      open a <i>read transaction</i> and read data from a database file.
    <p>
      Section <cite>writing_data</cite> describes the steps required to
      open a <i>write transaction </i> and write data to a database file.
    <p>
      Section <cite>rollback</cite> describes the way in which aborted
      <i>write transactions</i> may be rolled back (reverted), either as
      a result of an explicit user directive or because an application,
      operating system or power failure occurred while SQLite was midway
      through updating a database file.
    <p>
      Section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> describes some of the
      algorithms used to determine exactly which portions of the database
      file are cached by a <i>page cache</i>, and the effect that they
      have on the quantity and nature of the required VFS operations.
      It may at first seem odd to include the <i>page cache</i>, which is 
      primarily an implementation detail, in this document. However, it is
      necessary to acknowledge and describe the <i>page cache</i> in order to
      provide a more complete explanation of the nature and quantity of IO
      performed by SQLite. 
  <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <p class=todo>
      After this document is ready, make the vocabulary consistent and
      then add a glossary here.
<h1 id=vfs_assumptions>VFS Adaptor Related Assumptions</h1>
  <p>
    This section documents those assumptions made about the system that
    the VFS adaptor provides access to. The assumptions noted in section
    <cite>fs_characteristics</cite> are particularly important. If these
    assumptions are not true, then a power or operating system failure
    may cause SQLite databases to become corrupted.
  <h2 id=fs_performance>Performance Related Assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      SQLite uses the assumptions in this section to try to speed up 
      reading from and writing to the database file.
<p class=req id=A21010>
      It is assumed that writing a series of sequential blocks of data to 
      a file in order is faster than writing the same blocks in an arbitrary
      order.
</p>  <h2 id=fs_characteristics>System Failure Related Assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      In the event of an operating system or power failure, the various 
      combinations of file-system software and storage hardware available
      provide varying levels of guarantee as to the integrity of the data
      written to the file system just before or during the failure. The exact
      combination of IO operations that SQLite is required to perform in 
      order to safely modify a database file depend on the exact 
      characteristics of the target platform.
    <p>
      This section describes the assumptions that SQLite makes about the
      content of a file-system following a power or system failure. In
      other words, it describes the extent of file and file-system corruption
      that such an event may cause.
    <p>
      SQLite queries an implementation for file-system characteristics
      using the xDeviceCharacteristics() and xSectorSize() methods of the
      database file file-handle. These two methods are only ever called
      on file-handles open on database files. They are not called for 
      <i>journal files</i>, <i>master-journal files</i> or 
      <i>temporary database files</i>.
    <p>
      The file-system <i>sector size</i> value determined by calling the
      xSectorSize() method is a power of 2 value between 512 and 32768, 
      inclusive <span class=todo>reference to exactly how this is
      determined</span>. SQLite assumes that the underlying storage
      device stores data in blocks of <i>sector-size</i> bytes each, 
      sectors. It is also assumed that each aligned block of 
      <i>sector-size</i> bytes of each file is stored in a single device
      sector. If the file is not an exact multiple of <i>sector-size</i>
      bytes in size, then the final device sector is partially empty.
    <p>
      Normally, SQLite assumes that if a power failure occurs while 
      updating any portion of a sector then the contents of the entire 
      device sector is suspect following recovery. After writing to
      any part of a sector within a file, it is assumed that the modified
      sector contents are held in a volatile buffer somewhere within
      the system (main memory, disk cache etc.). SQLite does not assume
      that the updated data has reached the persistent storage media, until
      after it has successfully <i>synced</i> the corresponding file by
      invoking the VFS xSync() method. <i>Syncing</i> a file causes all
      modifications to the file up until that point to be committed to
      persistent storage.
    <p>
      Based on the above, SQLite is designed around a model of the
      file-system whereby any sector of a file written to is considered to be
      in a transient state until after the file has been successfully 
      <i>synced</i>. Should a power or system failure occur while a sector 
      is in a transient state, it is impossible to predict its contents
      following recovery. It may be written correctly, not written at all,
      overwritten with random data, or any combination thereof.
    <p>
      For example, if the <i>sector-size</i> of a given file-system is
      2048 bytes, and SQLite opens a file and writes a 1024 byte block
      of data to offset 3072 of the file, then according to the model 
      the second sector of the file is in the transient state. If a 
      power failure or operating system crash occurs before or during
      the next call to xSync() on the file handle, then following system
      recovery SQLite assumes that all file data between byte offsets 2048 
      and 4095, inclusive, is invalid. It also assumes that since the first
      sector of the file, containing the data from byte offset 0 to 2047 
      inclusive, is valid, since it was not in a transient state when the 
      crash occurred.
    <p>
      Assuming that any and all sectors in the transient state may be 
      corrupted following a power or system failure is a very pessimistic
      approach. Some modern systems provide more sophisticated guarantees
      than this. SQLite allows the VFS implementation to specify at runtime
      that the current platform supports zero or more of the following 
      properties:
    <ul>
      <li><p>The <b>safe-append</b> property. If a system supports the
          <i>safe-append</i> property, it means that when a file is extended
          the new data is written to the persistent media before the size
          of the file itself is updated. This guarantees that if a failure
          occurs after a file has been extended, following recovery 
          the write operations that extended the file will appear to have 
          succeeded or not occurred at all. It is not possible for invalid
          or garbage data to appear in the extended region of the file.
      <li><p>The <b>atomic-write</b> property. A system that supports this
          property also specifies the size or sizes of the blocks that it
          is capable of writing. Valid sizes are powers of two greater than
          512. If a write operation modifies a block of <i>n</i> bytes,
          where <i>n</i> is one of the block sizes for which <i>atomic-write</i>
          is supported, then it is impossible for an aligned write of <i>n</i>
          bytes to cause data corruption. If a failure occurs after such 
          a write operation and before the applicable file handle is
          <i>synced</i>, then following recovery it will appear as if the
          write operation succeeded or did not take place at all. It is not
          possible that only part of the data specified by the write operation
          was written to persistent media, nor is it possible for any content
          of the sectors spanned by the write operation to be replaced with
          garbage data, as it is normally assumed to be.
      <li><p>The <b>sequential-write</b> property. A system that supports the
          <i>sequential-write</i> property guarantees that the various write
          operations on files within the same file-system are written to the
          persistent media in the same order that they are performed by the
          application and that each operation is concluded before the next
          is begun. If a system supports the <i>sequential-write</i> 
          property, then the model used to determine the possible states of
          the file-system following a failure is different. 
          <p>If a system supports <i>sequential-write</i> it is assumed that 
          <i>syncing</i> any file within the file system flushes all write
          operations on all files (not just the <i>synced</i> file) to
          the persistent media. If a failure does occur, it is not known
          whether or not any of the write operations performed by SQLite 
          since the last time a file was <i>synced</i>. SQLite is able to
          assume that if the write operations of unknown status are arranged
          in the order that they occurred:
          <ol> 
            <li> the first <i>n</i> operations will have been executed 
                 successfully,
            <li> the next operation puts all device sectors that it modifies
                 into the transient state, so that following recovery each
                 sector may be partially written, completely written, not
                 written at all or populated with garbage data,
            <li> the remaining operations will not have had any effect on
                 the contents of the file-system.
          </ol> 
    </ul>
    <h3 id=fs_assumption_details>Failure Related Assumption Details</h3>
    <p>
      This section describes how the assumptions presented in the parent
      section apply to the individual API functions and operations provided 
      by the VFS to SQLite for the purposes of modifying the contents of the
      file-system.
    <p>
      SQLite manipulates the contents of the file-system using a combination
      of the following four types of operation:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Create file</b> operations. SQLite may create new files
           within the file-system by invoking the xOpen() method of
           the sqlite3_io_methods object.
      <li> <b>Delete file</b> operations. SQLite may remove files from the
           file system by calling the xDelete() method of the
           sqlite3_io_methods object.
      <li> <b>Truncate file</b> operations. SQLite may truncate existing 
           files by invoking the xTruncate() method of the sqlite3_file 
           object.
      <li> <b>Write file</b> operations. SQLite may modify the contents
           and increase the size of a file by files by invoking the xWrite() 
           method of the sqlite3_file object.
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, all VFS implementations are required to provide the
      <i>sync file</i> operation, accessed via the xSync() method of the
      sqlite3_file object, used to flush create, write and truncate operations
      on a file to the persistent storage medium.
    <p>
      The formalized assumptions in this section refer to <i>system failure</i>
      events.  In this context, this should be interpreted as any failure that
      causes the system to stop operating. For example a power failure or
      operating system crash.
    <p>
      SQLite does not assume that a <b>create file</b> operation has actually
      modified the file-system records within persistent storage until
      after the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>.
<p class=req id=A21001>
      If a system failure occurs during or after a "create file"
      operation, but before the created file has been <i>synced</i>, then 
      SQLite assumes that it is possible that the created file may not
      exist following system recovery.
</p>    <p>
      Of course, it is also possible that it does exist following system
      recovery.
<p class=req id=A21002>
      If a "create file" operation is executed by SQLite, and then the
      created file <i>synced</i>, then SQLite assumes that the file-system
      modifications corresponding to the "create file" operation have been
      committed to persistent media. It is assumed that if a system
      failure occurs any time after the file has been successfully 
      <i>synced</i>, then the file is guaranteed to appear in the file-system
      following system recovery.
</p>    <p>
      A <b>delete file</b> operation (invoked by a call to the VFS xDelete() 
      method) is assumed to be an atomic and durable operation. 
    </p>
<p class=req id=A21003>
      If a system failure occurs at any time after a "delete file" 
      operation (call to the VFS xDelete() method) returns successfully, it is
      assumed that the file-system will not contain the deleted file following
      system recovery.
</p><p class=req id=A21004>
      If a system failure occurs during a "delete file" operation,
      it is assumed that following system recovery the file-system will 
      either contain the file being deleted in the state it was in before
      the operation was attempted, or not contain the file at all. It is 
      assumed that it is not possible for the file to have become corrupted
      purely as a result of a failure occurring during a "delete file" 
      operation.
</p>    <p>
      The effects of a <b>truncate file</b> operation are not assumed to
      be made persistent until after the corresponding file has been
      <i>synced</i>.
<p class=req id=A21005>
      If a system failure occurs during or after a "truncate file"
      operation, but before the truncated file has been <i>synced</i>, then 
      SQLite assumes that the size of the truncated file is either as large
      or larger than the size that it was to be truncated to.
</p><p class=req id=A21006>
      If a system failure occurs during or after a "truncate file"
      operation, but before the truncated file has been <i>synced</i>, then 
      it is assumed that the contents of the file up to the size that the
      file was to be truncated to are not corrupted.
</p>    <p>
      The above two assumptions may be interpreted to mean that if a 
      system failure occurs after file truncation but before the truncated
      file is <i>synced</i>, the contents of the file following the point
      at which it was to be truncated may not be trusted. They may contain 
      the original file data, or may contain garbage.
<p class=req id=A21007>
      If a "truncate file" operation is executed by SQLite, and then the
      truncated file <i>synced</i>, then SQLite assumes that the file-system
      modifications corresponding to the "truncate file" operation have been
      committed to persistent media. It is assumed that if a system
      failure occurs any time after the file has been successfully 
      <i>synced</i>, then the effects of the file truncation are guaranteed
      to appear in the file system following recovery.
</p>    <p>
      A <b>write file</b> operation modifies the contents of an existing file
      within the file-system. It may also increase the size of the file.
      The effects of a <i>write file</i> operation are not assumed to
      be made persistent until after the corresponding file has been
      <i>synced</i>.
<p class=req id=A21008>
      If a system failure occurs during or after a "write file"
      operation, but before the corresponding file has been <i>synced</i>, 
      then it is assumed that the content of all sectors spanned by the
      <i>write file</i> operation are untrustworthy following system 
      recovery. This includes regions of the sectors that were not
      actually modified by the write file operation.
</p><p class=req id=A21011>
      If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the 
      <i>atomic-write</i> property for blocks of size <i>N</i> bytes
      following an aligned write of <i>N</i> 
      bytes to a file but before the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>,
      then is assumed following recovery that all sectors spanned by the
      write operation were correctly updated, or that none of the sectors were
      modified at all.
</p><p class=req id=A21012>
      If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the 
      <i>safe-append</i> following a write operation that appends data
      to the end of the file without modifying any of the existing file 
      content but before the file has been successfully <i>synced</i>,
      then is assumed following recovery that either the data was
      correctly appended to the file, or that the file size remains 
      unchanged. It is assumed that it is impossible that the file be
      extended but populated with incorrect data.
</p><p class=req id=A21013>
      Following a system recovery, if a device sector is deemed to be
      untrustworthy as defined by A21008 and neither A21011 or A21012 
      apply to the range of bytes written, then no assumption can be
      made about the content of the sector following recovery. It is
      assumed that it is possible for such a sector to be written 
      correctly, not written at all, populated with garbage data or any
      combination thereof.
</p><p class=req id=A21009>
      If a system failure occurs during or after a "write file"
      operation that causes the file to grow, but before the corresponding 
      file has been <i>synced</i>, then it is assumed that the size of 
      the file following recovery is as large or larger than it was when
      it was most recently <i>synced</i>.
</p>    <p>
      If a system supports the <i>sequential-write</i> property, then further
      assumptions may be made with respect to the state of the file-system
      following recovery from a <i>system failure</i>. Specifically, it is
      assumed that create, truncate, delete and write file operations are
      applied to the persistent representation in the same order as they 
      are performed by SQLite. Furthermore, it is assumed that the 
      file-system waits until one operation is safely written to the 
      persistent media before the next is attempted, just as if the relevant
      file were <i>synced</i> following each operation.
<p class=req id=A21014>
      If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the
      <i>sequential-write</i> property, then it is assumed that all 
      operations completed before the last time any file was <i>synced</i> 
      have been successfully committed to persistent media.
</p><p class=req id=A21015>
      If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the
      <i>sequential-write</i> property, then it is assumed that the set
      of possible states that the file-system may be in following recovery
      is the same as if each of the write operations performed since the most
      recent time a file was <i>synced</i> was itself followed by a <i>sync
      file</i> operation, and that the system failure may have occurred during
      any of the write or <i>sync file</i> operations.

    <p>
      The return value of the xSectorSize() method, the <i>sector-size</i>, is
      expected by SQLite to be a power of 2 value greater than or equal to 512.
    <p class=todo> 
      What does it do if this is not the case? If the sector size is less
      than 512 then 512 is used instead. How about a non power-of-two value?
      UPDATE: How this situation is handled should be described in the API
      requirements. Here we can just refer to the other document.
    <p>
      SQLite assumes that files are stored and written to within the
      file-system as a collection of blocks (hereafter sectors) of data, each
      <i>sector-size</i> bytes in size. This model is used to derive
      the following assumptions related to the expected state of the
      file-system following a power failure or operating system crash.
    <ul>
      <li>
          After part or all of a file sector has been modified
          using the xWrite() method of an open file-handle, the sector
          is said to be in a transient state, where the operating system
          makes no guarantees about the actual content of the sector on the
          persistent media. The sector remains in the transient state until
          the next successful call to xSync() on the same file-handle 
          returns. If a power failure or operating system crash occurs, then
          part or all of all sectors in the transient state when the crash
          occurred may contain invalid data following system recovery.
      <li>
          Following a power failure or operating system crash, the content
          of all sectors that were not in a transient state when the crash
          occurred may be trusted.
    </ul>
    <p class=todo>
      What do we assume about the other three file-system write 
      operations - xTruncate(), xDelete() and "create file"?
    <p>
      The xDeviceCharacteristics() method returns a set of flags, 
      indicating which of the following properties (if any) the 
      file-system provides:
    <ul>
      <li>The <b><i>sequential IO</i></b> property. If a file-system has this 
          property, then in the event of a crash at most a single sector
          may contain invalid data. The file-system guarantees
      <li>The <b><i>safe-append</i></b> property.
      <li>The <b><i>atomic write</i></b> property.
    </ul>
    <p class=todo>
      Write an explanation as to how the file-system properties influence
      the model used to predict file damage after a catastrophe.

<h1 id=database_connections>Database Connections</h1>
  <p>
    Within this document, the term <i>database connection</i> has a slightly
    different meaning from that which one might assume. The handles returned
    by the <code>sqlite3_open()</code> and <code>sqlite3_open16()</code>
    APIs (<span class=todo>reference</span>) are referred to as <i>database
    handles</i>.  A <i>database connection</i> is a connection to a single
    database file using a single file-handle, which is held open for the
    lifetime of the connection. Using the SQL ATTACH syntax, multiple
    <i>database connections</i> may be accessed via a single <i>database
    handle</i>. Or, using SQLite's <i>shared-cache mode</i> feature, multiple
    <i>database handles</i> may access a single <i>database connection</i>.
  <p>
    Usually, a new <i>database connection</i> is opened whenever the user opens
    new <i>database handle</i> on a real database file (not an in-memory
    database) or when a database file is attached to an existing <i>database
    connection</i> using the SQL ATTACH syntax. However if the <i>shared-cache
    mode</i> feature is enabled, then the database file may be accessed through
    an existing <i>database connection</i>. For more information on
    <i>shared-cache mode</i>, refer to <span class=todo>Reference</span>.  The
    various IO operations required to open a new connection are detailed in
    section <cite>open_new_connection</cite> of this document.
  <p>
    Similarly, a <i>database connection</i> is usually closed when the user
    closes a <i>database handle</i> that is open on a real database file or
    has had one or more real database files attached to it using the ATTACH
    mechanism, or when a real database file is detached from a <i>database
    connection</i> using the DETACH syntax. Again, the exception is if
    <i>shared-cache mode</i> is enabled. In this case, a <i>database
    connection</i> is not closed until its number of users reaches zero.
    The IO related steps required to close a <i>database connection</i> are
    described in section <cite>closing_database_connection</cite>.
  <p class=todo>
    After sections 4 and 5 are finished, come back here and see if we can add a
    list of state items associated with each database connection to make things
    easier to understand. i.e each database connection has a file handle, a set
    of entries in the page cache, an expected page size etc.
  <h2 id=open_new_connection>Opening a New Connection</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes the VFS operations that take place when a
      new database connection is created. 
    <p>
      Opening a new database connection is a two-step process:
    <ol>
      <li> A file-handle is opened on the database file.
      <li> If step 1 was successful, an attempt is made to read the 
           <i>database file header</i> from the database file using the 
           new file-handle.
    </ol>
    <p>
      In step 2 of the procedure above, the database file is not locked
      before it is read from. This is the only exception to the locking 
      rules described in section <cite>reading_data</cite>.
    <p>
      The reason for attempting to read the <i>database file header</i>
      is to determine the <i>page-size</i> used by the database file. 
      Because it is not possible to be certain as to the <i>page-size</i> 
      without holding at least a <i>shared lock</i> on the database file
      (because some other <i>database connection</i> might have changed it
      since the <i>database file header</i> was read), the value read from the
      <i>database file header</i> is known as the <i>expected page size</i>. 
<p class=req id=H35060>
When a new <i>database connection</i> is required, SQLite shall attempt
to open a file-handle on the database file. If the attempt fails, then
no new <i>database connection</i> is created and an error returned.
<p class=req id=H35070>
When a new <i>database connection</i> is required, after opening the
new file-handle, SQLite shall attempt to read the first 100 bytes
of the database file. If the attempt fails for any other reason than
that the opened file is less than 100 bytes in size, then
the file-handle is closed, no new <i>database connection</i> is created
and an error returned instead.
<p class=req id=H35080>
If the <i>database file header</i> is successfully read from a newly
opened database file, the connections <i>expected page-size</i> shall
be set to the value stored in the <i>page-size field</i> of the
database header.
<p class=req id=H35090>
If the <i>database file header</i> cannot be read from a newly opened
database file (because the file is less than 100 bytes in size), the
connections <i>expected page-size</i> shall be set to the compile time
value of the SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGESIZE option.
  <h2 id=closing_database_connection>Closing a Connection</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes the VFS operations that take place when an
      existing database connection is closed (destroyed). 
    <p>
      Closing a database connection is a simple matter. The open VFS 
      file-handle is closed and in-memory <i>page cache</i> related resources
      are released. 
<p class=req id=H35400>
When a <i>database connection</i> is closed, SQLite shall close the
associated file handle at the VFS level.
<p class=req id=H35430>
When a <i>database connection</i> is closed, all associated <i>page
cache</i> entries shall be discarded.
<h1 id=page_cache>The Page Cache</h1>
  <p>
    The contents of an SQLite database file are formatted as a set of 
    fixed size pages. See <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite> for a
    complete description of the format used. The <i>page size</i> used
    for a particular database is stored as part of the database file
    header at a well-known offset within the first 100 bytes of the 
    file. Almost all read and write operations performed by SQLite on
    database files are done on blocks of data <i>page-size</i> bytes
    in size. 
  <p>
    All SQLite database connections running within a single process share
    a single <i>page cache</i>. The <i>page cache</i> caches data read from
    database files in main-memory on a per-page basis. When SQLite requires
    data from a database file to satisfy a database query, it checks the <i>
    page cache</i> for usable cached versions of the required database
    pages before loading it from the database file. If no usable cache
    entry can be found and the database page data is loaded from the database
    file, it is cached in the <i>page cache</i> in case the same data is 
    needed again later. Because reading from the database file is assumed to
    be an order of magnitude slower than reading from main-memory, caching
    database page content in the <i>page cache</i> to minimize the number
    of read operations performed on the database file is a significant
    performance enhancement.
  <p>
    The <i>page cache</i> is also used to buffer database write operations.
    When SQLite is required to modify one of more of the <i>database pages</i>
    that make up a database file, it first modifies the cached version of
    the page in the <i>page cache</i>. At that point the page is considered
    a "dirty" page. At some point later on, the new content of the "dirty"
    page is copied from the <i>page cache</i> into the database file via
    the VFS interface. Buffering writes in the <i>page cache</i> can reduce
    the number of write operations required on the database file (in cases
    where the same page is updated twice) and allows optimizations based
    on the assumptions outlined in section <cite>fs_performance</cite>.
  <p>
    Database read and write operations, and the way in which they interact
    with and use the <i>page cache</i>, are described in detail in sections
    <cite>reading_data</cite> and <cite>writing_data</cite> of this document,
    respectively.
  <p>
    At any one time, the <i>page cache</i> contains zero or more <i>page cache
    entries</i>, each of which has the following data associated with it:
  <ul>
    <li><p>
      A reference to <b>the associated <i>database connection</i></b>. Each
      entry in the <i>page cache</i> is associated with a single <i>database
      connection</i>; the <i>database connection</i> that created the entry. 
      A <i>page cache entry</i> is only ever used by the <i>database 
      connection</i> that created it. Page cache entries are not shared between
      <i>database connections</i>.
    <li><p>
      The <b><i>page number</i></b> of the cached page. Pages are sequentially
      numbered within a database file starting from page 1 (page 1 begins at
      byte offset 0). Refer to <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite> for
      details.
    <li><p>
      The <b>cached data</b>; a blob of data <i>page-size</i> bytes in size.
  </ul>
  <p>
    The first two elements in the list above, the associated <i>database
    connection</i> and the <i>page number</i>, uniquely identify the
    <i>page cache entry</i>. At no time may the <i>page cache</i> contain two
    entries for which both the <i>database connection</i> and <i>page 
    number</i> are identical. Or, put another way, a single <i>database
    connection</i> never caches more than one copy of a database page
    within the <i>page cache</i>.
  <p>
    At any one time, each <i>page cache entry</i> may be said to be a <i>clean
    page</i>, a <i>non-writable dirty page</i> or a <i>writable dirty page</i>,
    according to the following definitions:
  <ul>
    <li> <p>A <b><i>clean page</i></b> is one for which the cached data 
         currently matches the contents of the corresponding page of 
         the database file. The page has not been modified since it was
         loaded from the file.
    <li> <p>A <b><i>dirty page</i></b> is a <i>page cache entry</i> for which
         the cached data has been modified since it was loaded from the database
         file, and so no longer matches the current contents of the
         corresponding database file page. A <i>dirty page</i> is one that is
         currently buffering a modification made to the database file as part
         of a <i>write transaction</i>. 
    <li> <p>Within this document, the term <b><i>non-writable dirty
         page</i></b> is used specifically to refer to a <i>page cache
         entry</i> with modified content for which it is not yet safe to update
         the database file with.  It is not safe to update a database file with
         a buffered write if a power or system failure that occurs during or
         soon after the update may cause the database to become corrupt
         following system recovery, according to the assumptions made in
         section <cite>fs_assumption_details</cite>.
    <li> <p>A <i>dirty page</i> for which it would be safe to update the
         corresponding database file page with the modified contents of 
         without risking database corruption is known as a 
         <b><i>writable dirty page</i></b>.
  </ul>
  <p>
    The exact logic used to determine if a <i>page cache entry</i> with
    modified content is a <i>dirty page</i> or <i>writable page</i> is
    presented in section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>.
  <p>
    Because main-memory is a limited resource, the <i>page cache</i> cannot
    be allowed to grow indefinitely. As a result, unless all database files
    opened by database connections within the process are quite small,
    sometimes data must be discarded from the <i>page cache</i>. In practice
    this means <i>page cache entries</i> must be purged to make room
    for new ones. If a <i>page cache entry</i> being removed from the <i>page
    cache</i> to free main-memory is a <i>dirty page</i>, then its contents
    must be saved into the database file before it can be discarded without
    data loss. The following two sub-sections describe the algorithms used by
    the <i>page cache</i> to determine exactly when existing <i>page cache
    entries</i> are purged (discarded).

    <p class=todo>
      Requirements describing the way in which the configuration parameters

<h1 id=reading_data>Reading Data</h1>
  <p>
    In order to return data from the database to the user, for example as
    the results of a SELECT query, SQLite must at some point read data
    from the database file. Usually, data is read from the database file in 
    aligned blocks of <i>page-size</i> bytes. The exception is when the
    database file header fields are being inspected, before the
    <i>page-size</i> used by the database can be known.
  <p>
    With two exceptions, a <i>database connection</i> must have an open 
    transaction (either a <i>read-only transaction</i> or a 
    <i>read/write transaction</i>) on the database before data may be 
    read from the database file. 
  <p>
    The two exceptions are:
  <ul>
    <li> When an attempt is made to read the 100 byte <i>database file
         header</i> immediately after opening the <i>database connection</i>
         (see section <cite>open_new_connection</cite>). When this occurs
         no lock is held on the database file.
    <li> Data read while in the process of opening a read-only transaction
         (see section <cite>open_read_only_trans</cite>). These read 
         operations occur after a <i>shared lock</i> is held on the database
         file.
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once a transaction has been opened, reading data from a database 
    connection is a simple operation. Using the xRead() method of the 
    file-handle open on the database file, the required database file 
    pages are read one at a time. SQLite never reads partial pages and
    always uses a single call to xRead() for each required page. 
   <p>
    After reading the data for a database page, SQLite stores the raw
    page of data in the <i>page cache</i>. Each time a page of data is 
    required by the upper layers, the <i>page cache</i> is queried
    to see if it contains a copy of the required page stored by
    the current <i>database connection</i>. If such an entry can be
    found, then the required data is read from the <i>page cache</i> instead
    of the database file. Only a connection with an open transaction
    transaction (either a <i>read-only transaction</i> or a 
    <i>read/write transaction</i>) on the database may read data from the
    <i>page cache</i>. In this sense reading from the <i>page cache</i> is no
    different to reading from the <i>database file</i>.
   <p>
    Refer to section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> for a description 
    of exactly how and for how long page data is stored in the 
    <i>page cache</i>.
<p class=req id=H35010>
Except for the read operation required by H35070 and those reads made
as part of opening a read-only transaction, SQLite shall ensure that
a <i>database connection</i> has an open read-only or read/write
transaction when any data is read from the <i>database file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35020>
Aside from those read operations described by H35070 and H21XXX, SQLite
shall read data from the database file in aligned blocks of
<i>page-size</i> bytes, where <i>page-size</i> is the database page size
used by the database file.
<p class=req id=H35420>
SQLite shall ensure that a <i>database connection</i> has an open
read-only or read/write transaction before using data stored in the <i>page
cache</i> to satisfy user queries.
  <h2 id=open_read_only_trans>Opening a Read-Only Transaction</h2>
    <p>
      Before data may be read from a <i>database file</i> or queried from
      the <i>page cache</i>, a <i>read-only transaction</i> must be
      successfully opened by the associated database connection (this is true
      even if the connection will eventually write to the database, as a
      <i>read/write transaction</i> may only be opened by upgrading from a
      <i>read-only transaction</i>). This section describes the procedure
      for opening a <i>read-only transaction</i>.
    <p>
      The key element of a <i>read-only transaction</i> is that the 
      file-handle open on the database file obtains and holds a
      <i>shared-lock</i> on the database file. Because a connection requires
      an <i>exclusive-lock</i> before it may actually modify the contents
      of the database file, and by definition while one connection is holding
      a <i>shared-lock</i> no other connection may hold an 
      <i>exclusive-lock</i>, holding a <i>shared-lock</i> guarantees that
      no other process may modify the database file while the <i>read-only
      transaction</i> remains open. This ensures that <i>read-only
      transactions</i> are sufficiently isolated from the transactions of
      other database users (see section <cite>overview</cite>).
    <p>Obtaining the <i>shared lock</i> itself on the database file is quite
       simple, SQLite just calls the xLock() method of the database file 
       handle. Some of the other processes that take place as part of 
       opening the <i>read-only transaction</i> are quite complex. The 
       steps that SQLite is required to take to open a <i>read-only
       transaction</i>, in the order in which they must occur, is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>A <i>shared-lock</i> is obtained on the database file.
      <li>The connection checks if a <i>hot journal file</i> exists in the
          file-system. If one does, then it is rolled back before continuing.
      <li>The connection checks if the data in the <i>page cache</i> may 
          still be trusted. If not, all page cache data is discarded.
      <li>If the file-size is not zero bytes and the page cache does not
          contain valid data for the first page of the database, then the
          data for the first page must be read from the database.
    </ol>
    <p>
      Of course, an error may occur while attempting any of the 4 steps
      enumerated above. If this happens, then the <i>shared-lock</i> is 
      released (if it was obtained) and an error returned to the user. 
      Step 2 of the procedure above is described in more detail in section
      <cite>hot_journal_detection</cite>. Section <cite>cache_validation</cite>
      describes the process identified by step 3 above. Further detail
      on step 4 may be found in section <cite>read_page_one</cite>.
<p class=req id=H35100>
When required to open a <i>read-only transaction</i> using a
<i>database connection</i>, SQLite shall first attempt to obtain
a <i>shared-lock</i> on the file-handle open on the database file.
<p class=req id=H35110>
If, while opening a <i>read-only transaction</i>, SQLite fails to obtain
the <i>shared-lock</i> on the database file, then the process is
abandoned, no transaction is opened and an error returned to the user.
    <p>
      The most common reason an attempt to obtain a <i>shared-lock</i> may
      fail is that some other connection is holding an <i>exclusive</i> or
      <i>pending lock</i>. However it may also fail because some other
      error (e.g. an IO or comms related error) occurs within the call to the
      xLock() method.
<p class=req id=H35030>
While opening a <i>read-only transaction</i>, after successfully
obtaining a <i>shared lock</i> on the database file, SQLite shall
attempt to detect and roll back a <i>hot journal file</i> associated
with the same database file.
<p class=req id=H35120>
If, while opening a <i>read-only transaction</i>, SQLite encounters
an error while attempting to detect or roll back a <i>hot journal
file</i>, then the <i>shared-lock</i> on the database file is released,
no transaction is opened and an error returned to the user.
    <p>
      Section <cite>hot_journal_detection</cite> contains a description of
      and requirements governing the detection of a hot-journal file referred
      to in the above requirements.
<p class=req id=H35040>
Assuming no errors have occurred, then after attempting to detect and
roll back a <i>hot journal file</i>, if the <i>page cache</i> contains
any entries associated with the current <i>database connection</i>,
then SQLite shall validate the contents of the <i>page cache</i> by
testing the <i>file change counter</i>.  This procedure is known as
<i>cache validation</i>.
    <p>
      The <i>cache validation</i> process is described in detail in section
      <cite>cache_validation</cite>
<p class=req id=H35050>
If the cache validate procedure prescribed by H35040 is required and
does not prove that the <i>page cache</i> entries associated with the
current <i>database connection</i> are valid, then SQLite shall discard
all entries associated with the current <i>database connection</i> from
the <i>page cache</i>.
    <p>
      The numbered list above notes that the data for the first page of the
      database file, if it exists and is not already loaded into the <i>page
      cache</i>, must be read from the database file before the <i>read-only
      transaction</i> may be considered opened. This is handled by 
      requirement H35240.
  <h3 id=hot_journal_detection>Hot Journal Detection</h3>
    <p>
      This section describes the procedure that SQLite uses to detect a
      <i>hot journal file</i>. If a <i>hot journal file</i> is detected,
      this indicates that at some point the process of writing a 
      transaction to the database was interrupted and a recovery operation
      (<i>hot journal rollback</i>) needs to take place. This section does
      not describe the process of <i>hot journal rollback</i> (see section
      <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>) or the processes by which a
      <i>hot journal file</i> may be created (see section
      <cite>writing_data</cite>).
    <p>
      The procedure used to detect a <i>hot-journal file</i> is quite
      complex. The following steps take place:
      <ol class=spacedlist>
        <li>Using the VFS xAccess() method, SQLite queries the file-system 
            to see if the journal file associated with the database exists. 
            If it does not, then there is no hot-journal file.
        <li>By invoking the xCheckReservedLock() method of the file-handle
            opened on the database file, SQLite checks if some other connection
            holds a <i>reserved lock</i> or greater. If some other connection
            does hold a <i>reserved lock</i>, this indicates that the other
            connection is midway through a <i>read/write transaction</i> (see
            section <cite>writing_data</cite>). In this case the 
            <i>journal file</i> is not a <i>hot-journal</i> and must not be 
            rolled back.
        <li>Using the xFileSize() method of the file-handle opened
            on the database file, SQLite checks if the database file is 
            0 bytes in size. If it is, the journal file is not considered
            to be a <i>hot journal</i> file. Instead of rolling back the
            journal file, in this case it is deleted from the file-system
            by calling the VFS xDelete() method. <span class=todo>Technically,
            there is a race condition here. This step should be moved to
            after the exclusive lock is held.</span>
        <li>An attempt is made to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> on the
            database file. If the attempt fails, then all locks, including 
            the recently obtained <i>shared lock</i> are dropped. The attempt
            to open a <i>read-only transaction</i> has failed. This occurs
            when some other connection is also attempting to open a 
            <i>read-only transaction</i> and the attempt to gain the
            <i>exclusive lock</i> fails because the other connection is also
            holding a <i>shared lock</i>. It is left to the other connection 
            to roll back the <i>hot journal</i>.
            <div style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>
            It is important that the file-handle lock is upgraded 
            directly from <i>shared</i> to <i>exclusive</i> in this case,
            instead of first upgrading to <i>reserved</i> or </i>pending</i>
            locks as is required when obtaining an <i>exclusive lock</i> to
            write to the database file (section <cite>writing_data</cite>).
            If SQLite were to first upgrade to a <i>reserved</i> or
            <i>pending</i> lock in this scenario, then a second process also
            trying to open a <i>read-transaction</i> on the database file might
            detect the <i>reserved</i> lock in step 2 of this process, 
            conclude that there was no <i>hot journal</i>, and commence
            reading data from the <i>database file</i>.
        <li>The xAccess() method is invoked again to detect if the journal 
            file is still in the file system. If it is, then it is a 
            hot-journal file and SQLite tries to roll it back (see section
            <cite>rollback</cite>).
      </ol>
    <p class=todo> Master journal file pointers?
    <p>
      The following requirements describe step 1 of the above procedure in
      more detail.
<p class=req id=H35140>
When required to attempt to detect a <i>hot-journal file</i>, SQLite
shall first use the xAccess() method of the VFS layer to check if a
journal file exists in the file-system.
<p class=req id=H35510>
If the call to xAccess() required by H35140 fails (due to an IO error or
similar), then SQLite shall abandon the attempt to open a <i>read-only
transaction</i>, relinquish the <i>shared lock</i> held on the database
file and return an error to the user.
<p class=req id=H35150>
When required to attempt to detect a <i>hot-journal file</i>, if the
call to xAccess() required by H35140 indicates that a journal file does
not exist, then SQLite shall conclude that there is no <i>hot-journal
file</i> in the file system and therefore that no <i>hot journal
rollback</i> is required.
    <p>
      The following requirements describe step 2 of the above procedure in
      more detail.
<p class=req id=H35160>
When required to attempt to detect a <i>hot-journal file</i>, if the
call to xAccess() required by H35140 indicates that a journal file
is present, then the xCheckReservedLock() method of the database file
file-handle is invoked to determine whether or not some other
process is holding a <i>reserved</i> or greater lock on the database
file.
<p class=req id=H35520>
If the call to xCheckReservedLock() required by H35160 fails (due to an
IO or other internal VFS error), then SQLite shall abandon the attempt
to open a <i>read-only transaction</i>, relinquish the <i>shared lock</i>
held on the database file and return an error to the user.
<p class=req id=H35170>
If the call to xCheckReservedLock() required by H35160 indicates that
some other <i>database connection</i> is holding a <i>reserved</i>
or greater lock on the database file, then SQLite shall conclude that
there is no <i>hot journal file</i>. In this case the attempt to detect
a <i>hot journal file</i> is concluded.
    <p>
      The following requirements describe step 3 of the above procedure in
      more detail.
<p class=req id=H35440>
If while attempting to detect a <i>hot-journal file</i> the call to
xCheckReservedLock() indicates that no process holds a <i>reserved</i>
or greater lock on the <i>database file</i>, then SQLite shall open
a file handle on the potentially hot journal file using the VFS xOpen()
method.
<p class=req id=H35530>
If the call to xOpen() required by H35440 fails (due to an IO or other
internal VFS error), then SQLite shall abandon the attempt to open a
<i>read-only transaction</i>, relinquish the <i>shared lock</i> held on
the database file and return an error to the user.
<p class=req id=H35450>
After successfully opening a file-handle on a potentially hot journal
file, SQLite shall query the file for its size in bytes using the
xFileSize() method of the open file handle.
<p class=req id=H35540>
If the call to xFileSize() required by H35450 fails (due to an IO or
other internal VFS error), then SQLite shall abandon the attempt to open
a <i>read-only transaction</i>, relinquish the <i>shared lock</i> held on
the database file, close the file handle opened on the journal file and
return an error to the user.
<p class=req id=H35460>
If the size of a potentially hot journal file is revealed to be zero
bytes by a query required by H35450, then SQLite shall close the
file handle opened on the journal file and delete the journal file using
a call to the VFS xDelete() method. In this case SQLite shall conclude
that there is no <i>hot journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35550>
If the call to xDelete() required by H35450 fails (due to an IO or
other internal VFS error), then SQLite shall abandon the attempt to open
a <i>read-only transaction</i>, relinquish the <i>shared lock</i> held on
the database file and return an error to the user.
    <p>
      The following requirements describe step 4 of the above procedure in
      more detail.
<p class=req id=H35470>
If the size of a potentially hot journal file is revealed to be greater
than zero bytes by a query required by H35450, then SQLite shall attempt
to upgrade the <i>shared lock</i> held by the <i>database connection</i>
on the <i>database file</i> directly to an <i>exclusive lock</i>.
<p class=req id=H35480>
If an attempt to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> prescribed by
H35470 fails for any reason, then SQLite shall release all locks held by
the <i>database connection</i> and close the file handle opened on the
<i>journal file</i>. The attempt to open a <i>read-only transaction</i>
shall be deemed to have failed and an error returned to the user.
    <p>
      Finally, the following requirements describe step 5 of the above
      procedure in more detail.
<p class=req id=H35490>
If, as part of the <i>hot journal file</i> detection process, the
attempt to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> mandated by H35470 is
successful, then SQLite shall query the file-system using the xAccess()
method of the VFS implementation to test whether or not the journal
file is still present in the file-system.
<p class=req id=H35560>
If the call to xAccess() required by H35490 fails (due to an IO or
other internal VFS error), then SQLite shall abandon the attempt to open
a <i>read-only transaction</i>, relinquish the lock held on the
database file, close the file handle opened on the journal file and
return an error to the user.
<p class=req id=H35570>
If the call to xAccess() required by H35490 reveals that the journal
file is no longer present in the file system, then SQLite shall abandon
the attempt to open a <i>read-only transaction</i>, relinquish the
lock held on the database file, close the file handle opened on the
journal file and return an SQLITE_BUSY error to the user.
<p class=req id=H35500>
If the xAccess() query required by H35490 reveals that the journal
file is still present in the file system, then SQLite shall conclude
that the journal file is a <i>hot journal file</i> that needs to
be rolled back. SQLite shall immediately begin <i>hot journal
rollback</i>.
  <h3 id=cache_validation>Cache Validation</h3>
    <p>
      When a <i>database connection</i> opens a <i>read transaction</i>, the
      <i>page cache</i> may already contain data associated with the
      <i>database connection</i>. However, if another process has modified 
      the database file since the cached pages were loaded it is possible that
      the cached data is invalid.
    <p>
      SQLite determines whether or not the <i>page cache</i> entries belonging
      to the <i>database connection</i> are valid or not using the <i>file
      change counter</i>, a field in the <i>database file header</i>. The
      <i>file change counter</i> is a 4-byte big-endian integer field stored
      starting at byte offset 24 of the <i>database file header</i>. Before the
      conclusion of a <i>read/write transaction</i> that modifies the contents
      of the database file in any way (see section <cite>writing_data</cite>),
      the value stored in the <i>file change counter</i> is incremented.  When
      a <i>database connection</i> unlocks the database file, it stores the
      current value of the <i>file change counter</i>. Later, while opening a
      new <i>read-only transaction</i>, SQLite checks the value of the <i>file
      change counter</i> stored in the database file. If the value has not
      changed since the database file was unlocked, then the <i>page cache</i>
      entries can be trusted. If the value has changed, then the <i>page
      cache</i> entries cannot be trusted and all entries associated with
      the current <i>database connection</i> are discarded.
<p class=req id=H35180>
When a file-handle open on a database file is unlocked, if the
<i>page cache</i> contains one or more entries belonging to the
associated <i>database connection</i>, SQLite shall store the value
of the <i>file change counter</i> internally.
<p class=req id=H35190>
When required to perform <i>cache validation</i> as part of opening
a <i>read transaction</i>, SQLite shall read a 16 byte block
starting at byte offset 24 of the <i>database file</i> using the xRead()
method of the <i>database connections</i> file handle.
    <p class=todo>
      Why a 16 byte block? Why not 4? (something to do with encrypted
      databases).
<p class=req id=H35200>
While performing <i>cache validation</i>, after loading the 16 byte
block as required by H35190, SQLite shall compare the 32-bit big-endian
integer stored in the first 4 bytes of the block to the most
recently stored value of the <i>file change counter</i> (see H35180).
If the values are not the same, then SQLite shall conclude that
the contents of the cache are invalid.
    <p>
      Requirement H35050 (section <cite>open_read_only_trans</cite>) 
      specifies the action SQLite is required to take upon determining that 
      the cache contents are invalid.
  <h3 id=read_page_one>Page 1 and the Expected Page Size</h3>
    <p>
      As the last step in opening a <i>read transaction</i> on a database
      file that is more than 0 bytes in size, SQLite is required to load 
      data for page 1 of the database into the <i>page cache</i>, if it is 
      not already there. This is slightly more complicated than it seems, 
      as the database <i>page-size</i> is no known at this point.
    <p>
      Even though the database <i>page-size</i> cannot be known for sure,
      SQLite is usually able to guess correctly by assuming it to be equal to
      the connections <i>expected page size</i>. The <i>expected page size</i>
      is the value of the <i>page-size</i> field read from the 
      <i>database file header</i> while opening the database connection 
      (see section <cite>open_new_connection</cite>), or the <i>page-size</i>
      of the database file when the most <i>read transaction</i> was concluded.
<p class=req id=H35210>
During the conclusion of a <i>read transaction</i>, before unlocking
the database file, SQLite shall set the connections
<i>expected page size</i> to the current database <i>page-size</i>.
<p class=req id=H35220>
As part of opening a new <i>read transaction</i>, immediately after
performing <i>cache validation</i>, if there is no data for database
page 1 in the <i>page cache</i>, SQLite shall read <i>N</i> bytes from
the start of the database file using the xRead() method of the
connections file handle, where <i>N</i> is the connections current
<i>expected page size</i> value.
<p class=req id=H35230>
If page 1 data is read as required by H35230, then the value of the
<i>page-size</i> field that appears in the database file header that
consumes the first 100 bytes of the read block is not the same as the
connections current <i>expected page size</i>, then the
<i>expected page size</i> is set to this value, the database file is
unlocked and the entire procedure to open a <i>read transaction</i>
is repeated.
<p class=req id=H35240>
If page 1 data is read as required by H35230, then the value of the
<i>page-size</i> field that appears in the database file header that
consumes the first 100 bytes of the read block is the same as the
connections current <i>expected page size</i>, then the block of data
read is stored in the <i>page cache</i> as page 1.
  <h2>Reading Database Data</h2>
  <p class=todo>
    Add something about checking the page-cache first etc.
  <h2>Ending a Read-only Transaction</h2>
    <p>
      To end a <i>read-only transaction</i>, SQLite simply relinquishes the
      <i>shared lock</i> on the file-handle open on the database file. No
      other action is required.
<p class=req id=H35130>
When required to end a <i>read-only transaction</i>, SQLite shall
relinquish the <i>shared lock</i> held on the database file by
calling the xUnlock() method of the file-handle.
    <p>
      See also requirements H35180 and H35210 above.
<h1 id=writing_data>Writing Data</h1>
  <p>
    Using DDL or DML SQL statements, SQLite users may modify the contents and
    size of a database file. Exactly how changes to the logical database are
    translated to modifications to the database file is described in 
    <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>. From the point of view of the
    sub-systems described in this document, each DDL or DML statement executed
    results in the contents of zero or more database file pages being 
    overwritten with new data. A DDL or DML statement may also append or 
    truncate one or more pages to or from the end of the database file. One 
    or more DDL and/or DML statements are grouped together to make up a 
    single <i>write transaction</i>. A <i>write transaction</i> is required 
    to have the special properties described in section <cite>overview</cite>; 
    a <i>write transaction</i> must be isolated, durable and atomic.
  <p>
    SQLite accomplishes these goals using the following techniques:
  <ul>
    <li><p>
        To ensure that <i>write transactions</i> are <b>isolated</b>, before
        beginning to modify the contents of the database file to reflect the
        results of a <i>write transaction</i>, SQLite obtains an <i>exclusive
        lock</i> on the <i>database file</i>. The lock is not relinquished
        until the <i>write transaction</i> is concluded. Because reading from
        the <i>database file</i> requires a <i>shared lock</i> (see section
        <cite>reading_data</cite>) and holding an <i>exclusive
        lock</i> guarantees that no other <i>database connection</i> is holding
        or can obtain a <i>shared lock</i>, this ensures that no other
        connection may read data from the <i>database file</i> at a point when
        a <i>write transaction</i> has been partially applied. 
    <li><p>Ensuring that <i>write transactions</i> are <b>atomic</b> is the most
        complex task required of the system. In this case, <i>atomic</i> means
        that even if a system failure occurs, an attempt to commit a <i>write
        transaction</i> to the database file either results in all changes
        that are a part of the transaction being successfully applied to the
        database file, or none of the changes are successfully applied. There
        is no chance that a subset of the changes only are applied. Hence from
        the point of view of an external observer, the <i>write transaction</i>
        appears to be an atomic event. 
        <p>
        Of course, it is usually not possible to atomically apply all the
        changes required by a <i>write transaction</i> to a database file
        within the file-system. For example, if a <i>write transaction</i>
        requires ten pages of a database file to be modified, and a power
        outage causes a system failure after sqlite has modified only five
        pages, then the database file will almost certainly be in an
        inconsistent state following system recovery.
        <p>
        SQLite solves this problem by using a <i>journal file</i>. In almost
        all cases, before the <i>database file</i> is modified in any way, 
        SQLite stores sufficient information in the <i>journal file</i> to
        allow the original the database file to be reconstructed if a system
        failure occurs while the database file is being updated to reflect
        the modifications made by the <i>write transaction</i>. Each time
        SQLite opens a database file, it checks if such a system failure has
        occurred and, if so, 
        reconstructs the database file based on the contents
        of the journal file. The procedure used to detect whether or not this
        process, coined <i>hot journal rollback</i>, is required is described
        in section <cite>hot_journal_detection</cite>. <i>Hot journal rollback
        </i> itself is described in section <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>.
        <p>
        The same technique ensures that an SQLite database file cannot be
        corrupted by a system failure that occurs at an inopportune moment.
        If a system failure does occur before SQLite has had a chance to
        execute sufficient <i>sync file</i> operations to ensure that the
        changes that make up a <i>write transaction</i> have made it safely
        to persistent storage, then the <i>journal file</i> will be used
        to restore the database to a known good state following system
        recovery.
    <li><p>
        So that <i>write transactions</i> are <b>durable</b> in the face of
        a system failure, SQLite executes a <i>sync file</i> operation on the
        database file before concluding the <i>write transaction</i>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <i>page cache</i> is used to buffer modifications to the database
    file image before they are written to the <i>database file</i>. When
    the contents of a page is required to be modified as the results of
    an operation within a <i>write transaction</i>, the modified copy is
    stored in the <i>page cache</i>. Similarly, if new pages are appended
    to the end of a database file, they are added to the <i>page cache</i>
    instead of being immediately written to the database file within the
    file-system. 
  <p>
    Ideally, all changes for an entire write transaction are buffered in
    the page cache until the end of the transaction. When the user commits
    the transaction, all changes are applied to the database file in the
    most efficient way possible, taking into account the assumptions 
    enumerated in section <cite>fs_performance</cite>. Unfortunately, since
    main-memory is a limited resource, this is not always possible for 
    large transactions. In this case changes are buffered in the <i>page
    cache</i> until some internal condition or limit is reached,
    then written out to the database file in order to free resources
    as they are required. Section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>
    describes the circumstances under which changes are flushed through
    to the database file mid-transaction to free <i>page cache</i> resources.
  <p>
    Even if an application or system failure does not occur while a
    <i>write transaction</i> is in progress, a rollback operation to restore
    the database file and <i>page cache</i> to the state that it was in before
    the transaction started may be required. This may occur if the user
    explicitly requests transaction rollback (by issuing a "ROLLBACK" command),
    or automatically, as a result of encountering an SQL constraint (see
    <cite>sql_sqlitert_requirements</cite>). For this reason, the original page
    content is stored in the <i>journal file</i> before the page is even
    modified within the <i>page cache</i>.
  <p class=todo>
    Introduce the following sub-sections.
  <h2 id=journal_file_format>Journal File Format</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes the format used by an SQLite <i>journal file</i>.
    <p>
      A journal file consists of one or more <i>journal headers</i>, zero
      or more <i>journal records</i> and optionally a <i>master journal
      pointer</i>. Each journal file always begins with a
      <i>journal header</i>, followed by zero or more <i>journal records</i>.
      Following this may be a second <i>journal header</i> followed by a
      second set of zero or more <i>journal records</i> and so on. There
      is no limit to the number of <i>journal headers</i> a journal file
      may contain. Following the <i>journal headers</i> and their accompanying
      sets of <i>journal records</i> may be the optional <i>master journal
      pointer</i>. Or, the file may simply end following the final <i>journal
      record</i>.
    <p>
      This section only describes the format of the journal file and the
      various objects that make it up. But because a journal file may be
      read by an SQLite process following recovery from a system failure
      (<i>hot journal rollback</i>, see section
      <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>) it is also important to describe
      the way the file is created and populated within the file-system
      using a combination of <i>write file</i>, <i>sync file</i> and
      <i>truncate file</i> operations. These are described in section

    <h3 id=journal_header_format>Journal Header Format</h3>
    <p>
      A <i>journal header</i> is <i>sector-size</i> bytes in size, where <i>
      sector-size</i> is the value returned by the xSectorSize method of
      the file handle opened on the database file. Only the first 28 bytes
      of the <i>journal header</i> are used, the remainder may contain garbage
      data. The first 28 bytes of each <i>journal header</i> consists of an 
      eight byte block set to a well-known value, followed by five big-endian 
      32-bit unsigned integer fields.

      Figure <cite>figure_journal_header</cite> graphically depicts the layout
      of a <i>journal header</i>. The individual fields are described in
      the following table. The offsets in the 'byte offset' column of the
      table are relative to the start of the <i>journal header</i>.

      All <i>journal headers</i> are positioned in the file so that they

      Each <i>journal record</i> contains the original data for a database page
      modified by the <i>write transaction</i>. If a rollback is required, then

      state it was in before the <i>write transaction</i> was started.

      A <i>journal record</i>, depicted graphically by figure

    <table class=striped>
      <tr><th>Byte offset<th>Size in bytes<th width=100%>Description
      <tr><td>0<td>4<td>The page number of the database page associated with

                        exactly as it appeared in the database file before the
                        <i>write transaction</i> began.
      <tr><td style="white-space: nowrap">4 + <i>page-size</i><td>4<td>
                        This field contains a checksum value, calculated based
                        on the contents of the journaled database page data
                        (the previous field) and the values stored in the
                        <i>checksum initializer</i> field of the preceding
                        <i>journal header</i>.
    </table>
    <p>
      The set of <i>journal records</i> that follow a <i>journal header</i>
      in a <i>journal file</i> are packed tightly together. There are no
      alignment requirements for <i>journal records</i> as there are for
      <i>journal headers</i>.
  <h3>Master Journal Pointer</h3>
    <p>
      To support <i>atomic</i> transactions that modify more than one 
      database file, SQLite sometimes includes a <i>master journal pointer</i>
      record in a <i>journal file</i>. Multiple file transactions are 
      described in section <cite>multifile_transactions</cite>. A <i>
      master journal pointer</i> contains the name of a <i>master journal-file
      </i> along with a check-sum and some well known values that allow
      the <i>master journal pointer</i> to be recognized as such when
      the <i>journal file</i> is read during a rollback operation (section
      <cite>rollback</cite>).
    <p>
      As is the case for a <i>journal header</i>, the start of a <i>master
      journal pointer</i> is always positioned at a <i>sector size</i> 
      aligned offset. If the <i>journal record</i> or <i>journal header</i>
      that appears immediately before the <i>master journal pointer</i> does
      not end at an aligned offset, then unused space is left between the
      end of the <i>journal record</i> or <i>journal header</i> and the start
      of the <i>master journal pointer</i>.
    <center><img src="images/fileformat/master_journal_ptr.gif">

      A <i>master journal pointer</i>, depicted graphically by figure
      <cite>figure_master_journal_ptr</cite>, contains five fields, as 
      described in the following table. Byte offsets are relative to the 
      start of the <i>master journal pointer</i>.
    <table class=striped>
      <tr><th>Byte offset<th>Size in bytes<th width=100%>Description
      <tr><td>0<td>4<td>This field, the <b>locking page number</b>, is always
               set to the page number of the database <i>locking page</i>
               stored as a 4-byte big-endian integer. The <i>locking page</i>
               is the page that begins at byte offset 2<super>30</super> of the
               database file. Even if the database file is large enough to
               contain the <i>locking page</i>, the <i>locking page</i> is
               never used to store any data and so the first four bytes of of a
               valid <i>journal record</i> will never contain this value. For
               further description of the <i>locking page</i>, refer to
               <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>.
      <tr><td>4<td><i>name-length</i><td>
               The <b>master journal name</b> field contains the name of the
               master journal file, encoded as a utf-8 string. There is no
               nul-terminator appended to the string.
      <tr><td>4 + <i>name-length</i><td><i>4<td>
               The <b>name-length</b> field contains the length of the

               unsigned integer.
      <tr><td>8 + <i>name-length</i><td><i>4<td>
               The <b>checksum</b> field contains a checksum value stored as
               a 4-byte big-endian signed integer. The checksum value is
               calculated as the sum of the bytes that make up the <i>
               master journal name</i> field, interpreting each byte as
               an 8-bit signed integer.
      <tr><td style="white-space: nowrap">12 + <i>name-length</i><td><i>8<td>
               Finally, the <b>journal magic</b> field always contains a

    </table>
  <h2 id=write_transactions>Write Transactions</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes the progression of an SQLite <i>write
      transaction</i>. From the point of view of the systems described in
      this document, most <i>write transactions</i> consist of three steps:
    <ol>
      <li><p>The <i>write transaction</i> is opened. This process is described
          in section <cite>opening_a_write_transaction</cite>.
      <li><p>The end-user executes DML or DDL SQL statements that require the
          structure of the database file of the database file to be modified.
          These modifications may be any combination of operations to 
          <ul><li>modify the content of an existing database page, 
              <li>append a new database page to the database file image, or
              <li>truncate (discard) a database page from the end of the
                  database file. 
          </ul>
          These operations are described in detail in section
          <cite>modifying_appending_truncating</cite>. How user DDL or DML
          SQL statements are mapped to combinations of these three operations
          is described in <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>.
      <li><p>The <i>write transaction</i> is concluded and the changes made
          permanently committed to the database. The process required to 
          commit a transaction is described in section
          <cite>committing_a_transaction</cite>.
    </ol>
    <p>
      As an alternative to step 3 above, the transaction may be rolled back.
      Transaction rollback is described in section <cite>rollback</cite>.
      Finally, it is also important to remember that a <i>write transaction</i>
      may be interrupted by a <i>system failure</i> at any point. In this
      case, the contents of the file-system (the <i>database file</i> and
      <i>journal file</i>) must be left in such a state so as to enable
      the <i>database file</i> to be restored to the state it was in before
      the interrupted <i>write transaction</i> was started. This is known
      as <i>hot journal rollback</i>, and is described in section
      <cite>hot_journal_rollback</cite>. Section
      <cite>fs_assumption_details</cite> describes the assumptions made 
      regarding the effects of a <i>system failure</i> on the file-system
      contents following recovery.
  <h3 id=opening_a_write_transaction>Beginning a Write Transaction</h3>
    <p>
      Before any database pages may be modified within the <i>page cache</i>,
      the <i>database connection</i> must open a <i>write transaction</i>. 
      Opening a <i>write transaction</i> requires that the <i>database
      connection</i> obtains a <i>reserved lock</i> (or greater) on the 
      <i>database file</i>. Because obtaining a <i>reserved lock</i> on
      a <i>database file</i> guarantees that no other <i>database
      connection</i> may hold or obtain a <i>reserved lock</i> or greater,
      it follows that no other <i>database connection</i> may have an
      open <i>write transaction</i>.
    <p>
      A <i>reserved lock</i> on the <i>database file</i> may be thought of
      as an exclusive lock on the <i>journal file</i>. No 
      <i>database connection</i> may read from or write to a <i>journal
      file</i> without a <i>reserved</i> or greater lock on the corresponding
      <i>database file</i>.
    <p>
      Before opening a <i>write transaction</i>, a <i>database connection</i>
      must have an open <i>read transaction</i>, opened via the procedure
      described in section <cite>open_read_only_trans</cite>. This ensures
      that there is no <i>hot-journal file</i> that needs to be rolled back
      and that any data stored in the <i>page cache</i> can be trusted.
    <p>
      Once a <i>read transaction</i> has been opened, upgrading to a 
      <i>write transaction</i> is a two step process, as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>A <i>reserved lock</i> is obtained on the <i>database file</i>.
      <li>The <i>journal file</i> is opened and created if necessary (using 
          the VFS xOpen method), and a <i>journal file header</i> written 
          to the start of it using a single call to the file handles xWrite 
          method.
    </ol>
    <p>
      Requirements describing step 1 of the above procedure in detail:
<p class=req id=H35350>
When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database,
SQLite shall first open a <i>read transaction</i>, if the <i>database
connection</i> in question has not already opened one.
<p class=req id=H35360>
When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, after
ensuring a <i>read transaction</i> has already been opened, SQLite
shall obtain a <i>reserved lock</i> on the database file by calling
the xLock method of the file-handle open on the database file.
<p class=req id=H35580>
If an attempt to acquire a <i>reserved lock</i> prescribed by
requirement H35360 fails, then SQLite shall deem the attempt to
open a <i>write transaction</i> to have failed and return an error
to the user.
    <p>
      Requirements describing step 2 of the above procedure in detail:
<p class=req id=H35370>
When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, after
obtaining a <i>reserved lock</i> on the database file, SQLite shall
open a read/write file-handle on the corresponding <i>journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35380>
When required to open a <i>write transaction</i> on the database, after
opening a file-handle on the <i>journal file</i>, SQLite shall append
a <i>journal header</i> to the (currently empty) <i>journal file</i>.
    <h4 id=writing_journal_header>Writing a Journal Header</h4>
    <p>
      Requirements describing how a <i>journal header</i> is appended to
      a journal file:
<p class=req id=H35680>
When required to append a <i>journal header</i> to the <i>journal
file</i>, SQLite shall do so by writing a block of <i>sector-size</i>
bytes using a single call to the xWrite method of the file-handle
open on the <i>journal file</i>. The block of data written shall begin
at the smallest sector-size aligned offset at or following the current
end of the <i>journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35690>
The first 8 bytes of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written
by H35680 shall contain the following values, in order from byte offset 0
to 7: 0xd9, 0xd5, 0x05, 0xf9, 0x20, 0xa1, 0x63 and 0xd7.
<p class=req id=H35700>
Bytes 8-11 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by
H35680 shall contain 0x00.
<p class=req id=H35710>
Bytes 12-15 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by
H35680 shall contain the number of pages that the database file
contained when the current <i>write-transaction</i> was started,
formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer.
<p class=req id=H35720>
Bytes 16-19 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by
H35680 shall contain pseudo-randomly generated values.
<p class=req id=H35730>
Bytes 20-23 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by
H35680 shall contain the <i>sector size</i> used by the VFS layer,
formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer.
<p class=req id=H35740>
Bytes 24-27 of the <i>journal header</i> required to be written by
H35680 shall contain the <i>page size</i> used by the database at
the start of the <i>write transaction</i>, formatted as a 4-byte
big-endian unsigned integer.
  <h3 id=modifying_appending_truncating>
    Modifying, Adding or Truncating a Database Page
  </h3>
    <p>
      When the end-user executes a DML or DDL SQL statement to modify the
      database schema or content, SQLite is required to update the database
      file image to reflect the new database state. This involves modifying
      the content of, appending or truncating one of more database file 
      pages. Instead of modifying the database file directly using the VFS
      interface, changes are first buffered within the <i>page cache</i>.
    <p>
      Before modifying a database page within the <i>page cache</i> that
      may need to be restored by a rollback operation, the page must be
      <i>journalled</i>. <i>Journalling a page</i> is the process of copying
      that pages original data into the journal file so that it can be
      recovered if the <i>write transaction</i> is rolled back. The process
      of journalling a page is described in section 
      <cite>journalling_a_page</cite>.
<p class=req id=H35590>
When required to modify the contents of an existing database page that
existed and was not a <i>free-list leaf page</i> when the <i>write
transaction</i> was opened, SQLite shall journal the page if it has not
already been journalled within the current <i>write transaction</i>.
<p class=req id=H35600>
When required to modify the contents of an existing database page,
SQLite shall update the cached version of the database page content
stored as part of the <i>page cache entry</i> associated with the page.
    <p>
      When a new database page is appended to a database file, there is
      no requirement to add a record to the <i>journal file</i>. If a 
      rollback is required the database file will simply be truncated back 
      to its original size based on the value stored at byte offset 12
      of the <i>journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35610>
When required to append a new database page to the database file,
SQLite shall create a new <i>page cache entry</i> corresponding to
the new page and insert it into the <i>page cache</i>. The <i>dirty
flag</i> of the new <i>page cache entry</i> shall be set.
    <p>
      If required to truncate a database page from the end of the database
      file, the associated <i>page cache entry</i> is discarded. The adjusted
      size of the database file is stored internally. The database file
      is not actually truncated until the current <i>write transaction</i>
      is committed (see section <cite>committing_a_transaction</cite>).
<p class=req id=H35620>
When required to truncate (remove) a database page that existed and was
not a <i>free-list leaf page</i> when the <i>write transaction</i> was
opened from the end of a database file, SQLite shall journal the page if
it has not already been journalled within the current <i>write
transaction</i>.
<p class=req id=H35630>
When required to truncate a database page from the end of the database
file, SQLite shall discard the associated <i>page cache entry</i>
from the page cache.
  <h4 id=journalling_a_page>Journalling a Database Page</h4>
    <p>
      A page is journalled by adding a <i>journal record</i> to the <i>
      journal file</i>. The format of a <i>journal record</i> is described
      in section <cite>journal_record_format</cite>.
<p class=req id=H35270>
When required to <i>journal a database page</i>, SQLite shall first
append the <i>page number</i> of the page being journalled to the
<i>journal file</i>, formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer,
using a single call to the xWrite method of the file-handle opened
on the journal file.
<p class=req id=H35280>
When required to <i>journal a database page</i>, if the attempt to
append the <i>page number</i> to the journal file is successful,
then the current page data (<i>page-size</i> bytes) shall be appended
to the journal file, using a single call to the xWrite method of the
file-handle opened on the journal file.
<p class=req id=H35290>
When required to <i>journal a database page</i>, if the attempt to
append the current page data to the journal file is successful,
then SQLite shall append a 4-byte big-endian integer checksum value
to the to the journal file, using a single call to the xWrite method
of the file-handle opened on the journal file.
    <p>
      The checksum value written to the <i>journal file</i> immediately after
      the page data (requirement H35290), is a function of both the page
      data and the <i>checksum initializer</i> field stored in the 
      <i>journal header</i> (see section <cite>journal_header_format</cite>).
      Specifically, it is the sum of the <i>checksum initializer</i> and
      the value of every 200th byte of page data interpreted as an 8-bit
      unsigned integer, starting with the (<i>page-size</i> % 200)'th 
      byte of page data. For example, if the <i>page-size</i> is 1024 bytes,
      then a checksum is calculated by adding the values of the bytes at
      offsets 23, 223, 423, 623, 823 and 1023 (the last byte of the page)
      together with the value of the <i>checksum initializer</i>.
<p class=req id=H35300>
The checksum value written to the <i>journal file</i> by the write
required by H35290 shall be equal to the sum of the <i>checksum
initializer</i> field stored in the <i>journal header</i> (H35700) and
every 200th byte of the page data, beginning with the
(<i>page-size</i> % 200)th byte.
    <p>
      The '%' character is used in requirement H35300 to represent the
      modulo operator, just as it is in programming languages such as C, Java
      and Javascript.
  <h3 id=syncing_journal_file>Syncing the Journal File</h3>
    <p>
      Even after the original data of a database page has been written into
      the journal file using calls to the journal file file-handle xWrite 
      method (section <cite>journalling_a_page</cite>), it is still not
      safe to write to the page within the database file. This is because
      in the event of a system failure the data written to the journal file
      may still be corrupted (see section <cite>fs_characteristics</cite>).
      Before the page can be updated within the database itself, the 
      following procedure takes place:
    <ol>
      <li> The xSync method of the file-handle opened on the journal file 
           is called. This operation ensures that all <i>journal records</i>
           in the journal file have been written to persistent storage, and
           that they will not become corrupted as a result of a subsequent
           system failure.
      <li> The <i>journal record count</i> field (see section 
           <cite>journal_header_format</cite>) of the most recently written
           journal header in the journal file is updated to contain the
           number of <i>journal records</i> added to the journal file since
           the header was written.
      <li> The xSync method is called again, to ensure that the update to
           the <i>journal record count</i> has been committed to persistent
           storage.
    </ol> 
    <p>
      If all three of the steps enumerated above are executed successfully,
      then it is safe to modify the content of the <i>journalled</i> 
      database pages within the database file itself. The combination of
      the three steps above is referred to as <i>syncing the journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35750>
When required to <i>sync the journal file</i>, SQLite shall invoke the
xSync method of the file handle open on the <i>journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35760>
When required to <i>sync the journal file</i>, after invoking the
xSync method as required by H35750, SQLite shall update the <i>record
count</i> of the <i>journal header</i> most recently written to the
<i>journal file</i>. The 4-byte field shall be updated to contain
the number of <i>journal records</i> that have been written to the
<i>journal file</i> since the <i>journal header</i> was written,
formatted as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer.
<p class=req id=H35770>
When required to <i>sync the journal file</i>, after updating the
<i>record count</i> field of a <i>journal header</i> as required by
H35760, SQLite shall invoke the xSync method of the file handle open
on the <i>journal file</i>.
  <h3 id=upgrading_to_exclusive_lock>Upgrading to an Exclusive Lock</h3>
    <p>
      Before the content of a page modified within the <i>page cache</i> may
      be written to the database file, an <i>exclusive lock</i> must be held
      on the database file. The purpose of this lock is to prevent another
      connection from reading from the database file while the first 
      connection is midway through writing to it. Whether the reason for
      writing to the database file is because a transaction is being committed,
      or to free up space within the <i>page cache</i>, upgrading to an 
      <i>exclusive lock</i> always occurs immediately after 
      <i>syncing the journal file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35780>
When required to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> as part of a write
transaction, SQLite shall first attempt to obtain a <i>pending lock</i>
on the database file if one is not already held by invoking the xLock
method of the file handle opened on the <i>database file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35790>
When required to upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> as part of a write
transaction, after successfully obtaining a <i>pending lock</i> SQLite
shall attempt to obtain an <i>exclusive lock</i> by invoking the
xLock method of the file handle opened on the <i>database file</i>.
    <p class=todo>
      What happens if the exclusive lock cannot be obtained? It is not
      possible for the attempt to upgrade from a reserved to a pending 
      lock to fail.
  <h3 id=committing_a_transaction>Committing a Transaction</h3>
    <p>
      Committing a <i>write transaction</i> is the final step in updating the
      database file. Committing a transaction is a seven step process,
      summarized as follows:
    <ol>
      <li><p>
        The database file header <i>change counter</i> field is incremented.
        The <i>change counter</i>, described in
        <cite>ff_sqlitert_requirements</cite>, is used by the <i>cache
        validation</i> procedure described in section
        <cite>cache_validation</cite>.
      <li><p> 
        The <i>journal file</i> is synced. The steps required to <i>sync the
        journal file</i> are described in section
        <cite>syncing_journal_file</cite>.
      <li><p>
        Upgrade to an <i>exclusive lock</i> on the database file, if an
        <i>exclusive lock</i> is not already held. Upgrading to an 
        <i>exclusive lock</i> is described in section
        <cite>upgrading_to_exclusive_lock</cite>.
      <li><p> 
        Copy the contents of all <i>dirty pages</i> stored in the <i>page
        cache</i> into the database file. The set of dirty pages are written
        to the database file in page number order in order to improve
        performance (see the assumptions in section <cite>fs_performance</cite>
        for details).
      <li><p>
        The database file is synced to ensure that all updates are stored
        safely on the persistent media.
      <li><p>
        The file-handle open on the <i>journal file</i> is closed and the
        journal file itself deleted. At this point the <i>write transaction</i>
        transaction has been irrevocably committed.
      <li><p>
        The database file is unlocked.
    </ol>
    <p class=todo>
      Expand on and explain the above a bit.
    <p>
      The following requirements describe the steps enumerated above in more
      detail.
<p class=req id=H35800>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, SQLite shall
modify page 1 to increment the value stored in the <i>change counter</i>
field of the <i>database file header</i>.
    <p>
      The <i>change counter</i> is a 4-byte big-endian integer field stored
      at byte offset 24 of the <i>database file</i>. The modification to page 1
      required by H35800 is made using the process described in section
      <cite>modifying_appending_truncating</cite>. If page 1 has not already
      been journalled as a part of the current write-transaction, then
      incrementing the <i>change counter</i> may require that page 1 be
      journalled. In all cases the <i>page cache entry</i> corresponding to
      page 1 becomes a <i>dirty page</i> as part of incrementing the <i>change
      counter</i> value.
<p class=req id=H35810>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after incrementing
the <i>change counter</i> field, SQLite shall <i>sync the journal
file</i>.
<p class=req id=H35820>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after <i>syncing
the journal file</i> as required by H35810, if an <i>exclusive lock</i>
on the database file is not already held, SQLite shall attempt to
<i>upgrade to an exclusive lock</i>.
<p class=req id=H35830>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after <i>syncing
the journal file</i> as required by H35810 and ensuring that an
<i>exclusive lock</i> is held on the database file as required by
H35830, SQLite shall copy the contents of all <i>dirty page</i>
stored in the <i>page cache</i> into the <i>database file</i> using
calls to the xWrite method of the <i>database connection</i> file
handle. Each call to xWrite shall write the contents of a single
<i>dirty page</i> (<i>page-size</i> bytes of data) to the database
file. Dirty pages shall be written in order of <i>page number</i>,
from lowest to highest.
<p class=req id=H35840>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after copying the
contents of any <i>dirty pages</i> to the database file as required
by H35830, SQLite shall sync the database file by invoking the xSync
method of the <i>database connection</i> file handle.
<p class=req id=H35850>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after syncing
the database file as required by H35840, SQLite shall close the
file-handle opened on the <i>journal file</i> and delete the
<i>journal file</i> from the file system via a call to the VFS
xDelete method.
<p class=req id=H35860>
When required to <i>commit a write-transaction</i>, after deleting
the <i>journal file</i> as required by H35850, SQLite shall relinquish
all locks held on the <i>database file</i> by invoking the xUnlock
method of the <i>database connection</i> file handle.
    <p class=todo>
      Is the shared lock held after committing a <i>write transaction</i>?
  <h3>Purging a Dirty Page</h3>
    <p>
      Usually, no data is actually written to the database file until the
      user commits the active <i>write transaction</i>. The exception is
      if a single <i>write transaction</i> contains too many modifications
      to be stored in the <i>page cache</i>. In this case, some of the 
      database file modifications stored in the <i>page cache</i> must be
      applied to the database file before the transaction is committed so
      that the associated <i>page cache entries</i> can be purged from the
      page cache to free memory. Exactly when this condition is reached and
      dirty pages must be purged is described in section
      <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>.
    <p>
      Before the contents of the <i>page cache entry</i> can be written into
      the database file, the <i>page cache entry</i> must meet the criteria
      for a <i>writable dirty page</i>, as defined in section
      <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite>. If the dirty page selected by the
      algorithms in section <cite>page_cache_algorithms</cite> for purging,
      SQLite is required to <i>sync the journal file</i>. Immediately after
      the journal file is synced, all dirty pages associated with the
      <i>database connection</i> are classified as <i>writable dirty pages</i>.
<p class=req id=H35640>
When required to purge a <i>non-writable dirty page</i> from the
<i>page cache</i>, SQLite shall <i>sync the journal file</i> before
proceeding with the write operation required by H35670.
<p class=req id=H35660>
After <i>syncing the journal file</i> as required by H35640, SQLite
shall append a new <i>journal header</i> to the <i>journal file</i>
before proceeding with the write operation required by H35670.
    <p>
      Appending a new <i>journal header</i> to the journal file is described
      in section <cite>writing_journal_header</cite>.
    <p>
      Once the dirty page being purged is writable, it is simply written
      into the database file.
<p class=req id=H35670>
When required to purge a <i>page cache entry</i> that is a
<i>dirty page</i> SQLite shall write the page data into the database
file, using a single call to the xWrite method of the <i>database
connection</i> file handle.
