<p>SQLite version 3.8.11.1 is a patch release that fixes two arcane
   issues that were reported shortly after 3.8.11 was released.  Upgrade
   from 3.8.11 only in the unlikely event that one of these obscure
   issues affect your code.

<p>Yikes!  Index corruption after a sequence of valid SQL statements!
<p>It has been many years since anything like 
   <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/34cd55d6">this bug</a> has snuck into
   an official SQLite release.  But for the pasts seven months
   (<a href="releaselog/3_8_7.html">version 3.8.7</a> through <a href="releaselog/3_8_10_1.html">version 3.8.10.1</a>)
   if you do an INSERT into a carefully
   crafted schema in which there are two nested triggers that convert
   an index key value from TEXT to INTEGER and then back
   to TEXT again, the INTEGER value might get inserted as the index
   key instead of the correct TEXT, resulting in index corruption.
   This patch release adds a single line of code to fix the problem.
<p>If you do actually encounter this problem, running <a href="lang_reindex.html">REINDEX</a> on the
   damaged indexes will clear it.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_05_09"></a><h3>2015-05-09 - Release 3.8.10.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>The 3.8.10 release did not add the new <a href="compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab">SQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB</a>
   compile-time option to the <a href="c3ref/compileoption_get.html">sqlite3_compileoption_used()</a> interface.
   This patch release fixes that omission.  And while we are at it,
   the associated <a href="dbstat.html">dbstat virtual table</a> was enhanced slightly and a
   harmless compiler warning was fixed.</p>

<p>   <p>There is no reason to upgrade from version 3.8.10 unless you are
   using the new <a href="compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab">SQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB</a> compile-time option.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_05_07"></a><h3>2015-05-07 - Release 3.8.10</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite version 3.8.10 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   This release features performance improvements, fixes to several
   arcane bugs found by the AFL fuzzer, the new "sqldiff.exe" command-line
   utility, improvements to the documentation, and other enhancements.
   See the <a href='releaselog/3_8_10.html'>release notes</a> for 
   additional information.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_04_08"></a><h3>2015-04-08 - Release 3.8.9</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite version 3.8.9 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   New features in this release include the 
   <a href="pragma.html#pragma_index_xinfo">PRAGMA index_xinfo</a> command, the <a href="c3ref/status.html">sqlite3_status64()</a> interface,
   and the ".dbinfo" command of the <a href="cli.html">command-line shell</a>.
   See the <a href='releaselog/3_8_9.html'>release notes</a> for
   additional information.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_02_25"></a><h3>2015-02-25 - Release 3.8.8.3</h3><blockquote>
<p>The 3.8.8.3 patch release fixes an obscure problem in the SQLite code
   generator that can cause incorrect results when the qualifying expression
   of a <a href="partialindex.html">partial index</a> is used inside the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN.
   This problem has been in the code since support for partial indexes
   was first added in version 3.8.0.  However, it is difficult to imagine
   a valid reason to every put the qualifying constraint inside the ON
   clause of a LEFT JOIN, and so this issue has never come up before.</p>

<p><p>Any applications that is vulnerable to this bug would have encountered
   problems already.  Hence, upgrading from the previous release is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_01_30"></a><h3>2015-01-30 - Release 3.8.8.2</h3><blockquote>
<p>The 3.8.8.2 patch release fixes a single minor problem:  It ensures
   that the <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)</a> operation will always truncate
   the <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> even if log had already been reset and contained
   no new content.  It is unclear if this is a bug fix or a new feature.</p>

<p><p>Something like this would normally go into the next regularly scheduled
   release, but a prominent SQLite user needed the change in a hurry so
   we were happy to rush it out via this patch.</p>

<p><p>There is no reason to upgrade unless you actually need the enhanced
   behavior of <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_01_20"></a><h3>2015-01-20 - Release 3.8.8.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>Within hours of releasing version 3.8.8, a bug was reported against
   the 10-month-old 3.8.4 release.  As that bug exists in all subsequent
   releases, the decision was made to issue a small patch to the
   3.8.8 before it came into widespread use.</p>

<p><p>The changes between versions 3.8.8 and 3.8.8.1 are minimal.

<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_8.html">version 3.8.8</a> is a regularly schedule maintenance release of
   SQLite.</p>

<p><p>There are no dramatic new features or performance enhancements in this
   release, merely incremental improvements.  Most of the performance gain
   in this release comes from refactoring the B-Tree rebalancing logic to
   avoid unnecessary memcpy() operations.  New features include the
   <a href="pragma.html#pragma_data_version">PRAGMA data_version</a> statement and the ability to accept a
   <a href="lang_select.html#values">VALUES clause</a> with no arbitrary limit on the number of rows.
   Several obscure bugs have been fixed, including some multithreading
   races and a work-around for a compiler bug on some Macs.</p>

   enhancements and bug fixes.

   the previous release and from <a href="releaselog/3_8_7.html">version 3.8.7</a> are minimal.</p>

<p><p>This release fixes adds in a mutex that is required by the changes of
   the 3.8.7.3 patch but was accidentally omitted.  The mutex was not required
   by any of the internal SQLite tests, but Firefox crashes without it.
   Test cases have been added to ensure that mutex is never again missed.

   the previous release and from <a href="releaselog/3_8_7.html">version 3.8.7</a> are minimal.</p>

<p><p>This release fixes two obscure bugs that can result in incorrect
   query results and/or application crashes, but not (as far as we can
   tell) security vulnerabilities.  Both bugs have been latent in the
   code across multiple prior releases and have never before been encountered,
   so they are unlikely to cause problems.  Nevertheless
   it seems prudent to publish fixes for them both.  See the
   change log for details.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_11_19"></a><h3>2014-11-19 - Release 3.8.7.2</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_7_2.html">version 3.8.7.2</a> is a patch and bug-fix release.  Changes from
   the previous release are minimal.</p>

<p><p>The primary reason for this release is to enhance the <a href="lang_transaction.html">ROLLBACK</a> command
   so that it allows running queries on the same database connection to 
   continue running as long as the ROLLBACK does not change the schema.
   In all previous versions of SQLite, a ROLLBACK would cause pending
   queries to stop immediately and return <a href="rescode.html#abort">SQLITE_ABORT</a> or
   <a href="rescode.html#abort_rollback">SQLITE_ABORT_ROLLBACK</a>. Pending queries still abort if the ROLLBACK
   changes the database schema, but as of this patch release, the queries
   are allowed to continue running if the schema is unmodified.</p>

<p><p>In addition to the ROLLBACK enhancement, this patch release also
   includes fixes for three obscure bugs.  See the 
   <a href="releaselog/3_8_7_2.html">change log</a> for details.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_10_30"></a><h3>2014-10-30 - Release 3.8.7.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_7_1.html">version 3.8.7.1</a> is a bug-fix release.</p>

<p><p>The primary reason for this bug-fix release is to address a problem with
   updating the value of fields at the end of a table that were added
   using <a href="lang_altertable.html">ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN</a>.  This problem
   <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/43107840f1c02">1</a> first appeared in the
   3.8.7 release.</p>

<p><p>Another minor annoyance in the 3.8.7 release was the fact that the
   Android build tried to use the strchrnul() function from the standard
   C library but that function is not available on Android.  Android builds
   had to add -DHAVE_STRCHRNUL=0 to work around the problem.  This patch
   fixes that so that Android builds should now work without any changes.</p>

<p><p>The operation of <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">PRAGMA journal_mode=TRUNCATE</a> has been enhanced so that
   it invokes fsync() after truncating the journal file when
   <a href="pragma.html#pragma_synchronous">PRAGMA synchronous=FULL</a>.  This helps to preserve transaction durability
   in the case of a power loss occurring shortly after commit.</p>

<p><p>Finally, a couple of long-standing and obscure problems associated with run
   UPDATE and DELETE on VIEWs were fixed.</p>

<p><p>The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/vdiff?from=e4ab094f8afce0817f4074e823fabe59fc29ebb4&to=83afe23e553e802c0947c80d0ffdd120423e7c52&sbs=1">changes from 3.8.7</a> are minimal.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_10_17"></a><h3>2014-10-17 - Release 3.8.7</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_7.html">version 3.8.7</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   Upgrading from all prior versions is recommended.</p>

<p><p>Most of the changes from the previous release have been micro-optimizations
   designed to help SQLite run a little faster.  Each individual optimization
   has an unmeasurably small performance impact.  But the improvements add up.
   Measured on a well-defined workload (which the SQLite developers use
   as a proxy for a typical application workload) using cachegrind on Linux
   and compiled with gcc 4.8.1 and -Os on x64 linux, the current release 
   does over 20% more work for the same number of CPU cycles compared to the
   previous release.  Cachegrind is not a real CPU, and the workload
   used for measurement is only a proxy.  So your performance may vary.
   We expect to see about half the measured and reported improvement in
   real-world applications. 10% is less than 20% but it is still pretty
   good, we think.</p>

<p><p>This release includes a new set of C-language interfaces that have
   unsigned 64-bit instead of signed 32-bit length parameters.  The new
   APIs do not provide any new capabilities.  But they do make it easier
   to write applications that are more resistant to integer overflow
   vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><p>This release also includes a new sorter that is able to use multiple
   threads to help with large sort operations.  (Sort operations are
   sometimes required to implement ORDER BY and/or GROUP BY clauses and
   are almost always required for CREATE INDEX.)  The multi-threads sorter
   is turned off by default and must be enabled using the
   <a href="pragma.html#pragma_threads">PRAGMA threads</a> SQL command.  Note that the multi-threaded sorter
   provides faster real-time performance for large sorts, but it also
   uses more CPU cycles and more energy.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_08_15"></a><h3>2014-08-15 - Release 3.8.6</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_6.html">version 3.8.6</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   Upgrading from all previous versions is recommended.</p>

<p><p>This release contains the usual assortment of obscure bug fixes.
   One bug, however, deserves special attention.
   A problem appeared in the <a href="lang_createindex.html">CREATE INDEX</a> command beginning with
   <a href="releaselog/3_8_2.html">version 3.8.2</a> (2013-12-06) that allowed, under some circumstances,
   a UNIQUE index to be created on a column that was not unique.  Once
   the index was created, no new non-unique entries could be inserted, but
   preexisting non-unique entries would remain.  See ticket
   <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9a6daf340df99ba93c">9a6daf340df99ba93c</a>
   for further information.  In addition to fixing this bug, the
   <a href="pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check">PRAGMA integrity_check</a> command has been enhanced to detect
   non-uniqueness in UNIQUE indices, so that if this bug did introduce
   any problems in databases, those problems can be easily detected.</p>

<p><p>Other noteworthy changes include the addition of support for
   <a href="lang_expr.html#hexint">hexadecimal integers</a> (ex: 0x1234), and performance enhancements
   to the <a href="lang_expr.html#in_op">IN operator</a> which, according to 
   <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users%40sqlite.org/msg85350.html">mailing list reports</a>,
   help some queries run up to five times faster.</p>

<p><p>Version 3.8.6 uses 25% fewer CPU cycles than version 3.8.0 from
   approximately one year ago, according to <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a>
   and the
   <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact/d29c8048beb7e">test/speedtest1.c</a>
   test program.
   On the other hand,
   the compiled binary for version 3.8.6 is about 5% larger than 3.8.0.
   The size increase is 
   due in part to the addition of new features such as <a href="withoutrowid.html">WITHOUT ROWID</a>
   tables and <a href="lang_with.html">common table expressions</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_06_04"></a><h3>2014-06-04 - Release 3.8.5</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_5.html">version 3.8.5</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   Upgrading from the previous version is recommended.</p>

<p><p>Version 3.8.5 fixes more than a dozen obscure bugs.  None of these
   bugs should be a problem for existing applications.  Nor do any of
   the bugs represent a security vulnerability.  Nevertheless, upgrading
   is recommended to prevent future problems.</p>

<p><p>In addition to bug fixes, the 3.8.5 release adds improvements to the
   query planner, especially regarding sorting using indices and handling 
   OR terms
   in the WHERE clause for WITHOUT ROWID tables.  The ".system" and
   ".once" dot-commands were added to the command-line interface.  And
   there were enhancements to the FTS4 and RTREE virtual tables.  See
   the change log for details.

<p>The optimizations added in <a href="releaselog/3_8_4.html">version 3.8.4</a> caused some queries that involve
   subqueries in the FROM clause, DISTINCT, and ORDER BY clauses, to give an incorrect
   result.  See

<p>The code changes that resulted in the performance improvements

<p><p>Version 3.8.4 of SQLite fixes several corner-case bugs that were
   found since the previous release.  These bugs were unlikely to appear
   in practice, and none represent a security vulnerability. 
   Nevertheless, developers are encouraged to upgrade from all prior releases.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_02_11"></a><h3>2014-02-11 - Release 3.8.3.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_3_1.html">version 3.8.3.1</a> fixes a bug present in versions 3.8.1,
   3.8.2 and 3.8.3 that can cause queries to omit valid output rows.
   Upgrading from those versions is recommended.</p>

<p><p>The problem only comes up if SQLite is compiled with either the
   <a href="compile.html#enable_stat3">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3</a> or <a href="compile.html#enable_stat4">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4</a> compile-time options.
   In that case, if a query has a WHERE clause that contains expressions
   like this:
   <blockquote>
WHERE (expr1 OR expr2 OR ... OR exprN) AND column IS NOT NULL
   </blockquote>
   Where all of expr1 through exprN are suitable for use by indexes,
   then during query planning SQLite might mistakenly converted
   the "column IS NOT NULL" term into "column>NULL".  But the latter
   term is never true, and so the query would return no rows.</p>

<p><p>The trouble ticket for this bug is
   &#91;<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4c86b126f2">4c86b126f2</a>&#93;.
   It is recommended that all users upgrade to avoid this problem.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2014_02_03"></a><h3>2014-02-03 - Release 3.8.3</h3><blockquote>
  <p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_3.html">version 3.8.3</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from the previous release is optional.</p>

<p>  <p>The most visible change in version 3.8.3 is the addition of
  support for <a href="lang_with.html">common table expressions</a>.  It is now possible to write a
  single <a href="lang_select.html">SELECT</a> statement that will query a tree or graph, using either
  a depth-first or a breadth-first search.  A single SQLite query will 
  even <a href="lang_with.html#sudoku">solve Sudoku puzzles</a> or <a href="lang_with.html#mandelbrot">compute the Mandelbrot set</a>.  As part
  of this change, SQLite now accepts a <a href="lang_select.html#values">VALUES clause</a> anyplace that
  a <a href="lang_select.html">SELECT</a> statement is valid.</p>

<p>  <p>This release also includes many small performance enhancements which
  should give a small speed boost to legacy applications.  And there are
  other minor enhancements such as the addition of the <a href="lang_corefunc.html#printf">printf()</a> SQL
  function.  See the <a href="releaselog/3_8_3.html">change log</a> for details.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_12_06"></a><h3>2013-12-06 - Release 3.8.2</h3><blockquote>
  <p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_2.html">version 3.8.2</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from the previous release is optional.</p>

<p>  <p>Version 3.8.2 adds support for <a href="withoutrowid.html">WITHOUT ROWID</a> tables.  This is a
  significant extension to SQLite.  Database files that contain WITHOUT ROWID
  tables are not readable or writable by prior versions of SQLite, however
  databases that do not use WITHOUT ROWID tables are fully backwards 
  and forwards compatible.</p>

<p>  <p>The 3.8.2 release contains a potentially incompatible change.  In
  all prior versions of SQLite, a <a href="lang_expr.html#castexpr">cast</a> from a very large positive 
  floating point number into an integer resulted in the most negative integer.
  In other words, CAST(+99.9e99 to INT) would yield -9223372036854775808.
  This behavior came about because it is what x86/x64 hardware does 
  for the equivalent cast in the C language.  But the behavior is
  bizarre.  And so it has been changed effective with this release so that
  a cast from a floating point number into an integer returns the integer
  between the floating point value and zero that is closest to the floating
  point value.  Hence, CAST(+99.9e99 to INT) now returns +9223372036854775807.
  Since routines like <a href="c3ref/column_blob.html">sqlite3_column_int64()</a> do an implicit cast if the
  value being accessed is really a floating point number, they are also
  affected by this change.</p>

<p>  <p>Besides the two changes mentioned above, the 3.8.2 release also 
  includes a number of performance enhancements.  The
  <a href="optoverview.html#skipscan">skip-scan optimization</a> is now available for databases that have been
  processed by <a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a>.  Constant SQL functions are now factored out of
  inner loops, which can result in a significant speedup for queries that
  contain WHERE clause terms like "date>datetime('now','-2 days')".  And
  various high-runner internal routines have been refactored for reduced
  CPU load.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_10_17"></a><h3>2013-10-17 - Release 3.8.1</h3><blockquote>
  <p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_1.html">version 3.8.1</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from the previous release is optional, though you should upgrade
  if you are using <a href="partialindex.html">partial indices</a> as there was a 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/a5c8ed66ca">bug</a> related to partial
  indices in the previous release that could result in an incorrect answer
  for count(*) queries.</p>

<p>  <p>The <a href="queryplanner-ng.html">next generation query planner</a> that was premiered in the previous
  release continues to work well.  
  The new query planner has been tweaked slightly
  in the current release to help it make better decisions in some
  cases, but is largely unchanged.  Two new SQL functions, <a href="lang_corefunc.html#likelihood">likelihood()</a> and
  <a href="lang_corefunc.html#unlikely">unlikely()</a>, have been added to allow developers to give hints to the
  query planner without forcing the query planner into a particular decision.</p>

<p>  <p>Version 3.8.1 is the first SQLite release to take into account the
  estimated size of table and index rows when choosing a query plan.
  Row size estimates are based on the declared datatypes of columns.
  For example, a column of type VARCHAR(1000) is assumed
  to use much more space than a column of type INT.  The datatype-based
  row size estimate can be
  overridden by appending a term of the form "sz=NNN" (where NNN is the
  average row size in bytes) to the end of the <a href="fileformat2.html#stat1tab">sqlite_stat1.stat</a>
  record for a table or index.  Currently, row sizes are only used to help the
  query planner choose between a table or one of its indices when doing a
  table scan or a count(*) operation, though future releases are likely
  to use the estimated row size in other contexts as well.  The new
  <a href="pragma.html#pragma_stats">PRAGMA stats</a> statement can be used to view row size estimates.</p>

<p>  <p>Version 3.8.1 adds the <a href="compile.html#enable_stat4">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4</a> compile-time option.
  STAT4 is very similar to STAT3 in that it uses samples from indices to 
  try to guess how many rows of the index will be satisfy by WHERE clause
  constraints.  The difference is that STAT4 samples all columns of the
  index whereas the older STAT3 only sampled the left-most column.  Users
  of STAT3 are encouraged to upgrade to STAT4.  Application developers should
  use STAT3 and STAT4 with caution since both options, by design, violate 
  the <a href="queryplanner-ng.html#qpstab">query planner stability guarantee</a>, making it more difficult to ensure
  uniform performance is widely-deployed and mass-produced embedded
  applications.

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2013_08_26"></a><h3>2013-08-26 - Release 3.8.0</h3><blockquote>
  <b>Do not fear the zero!</b></p>

<p>  <p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_0.html">version 3.8.0</a> might easily have been called "3.7.18" instead.
  However, this release features the cutover of the
  <a href="queryplanner-ng.html">next generation query planner</a> or <a href="queryplanner-ng.html">NGQP</a>, and there is a small chance of
  <a href="queryplanner-ng.html#hazards">breaking legacy programs</a> that
  rely on undefined behavior in previous SQLite releases, and so the
  minor version number was incremented for that reason.
  But the risks are low and there is a <a href="queryplanner-ng.html#howtofix">query planner checklist</a> is 
  available to application developers to aid in avoiding problems.</p>

<p>  <p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_0.html">version 3.8.0</a> is actually one of the most heavily tested
  SQLite releases ever.  Thousands and thousands of beta copies have

<p>  <p>In addition to the <a href="queryplanner-ng.html">next generation query planner</a>, the 3.8.0 release

<p>  There are many bug fixes in version 3.7.17.  But this does not indicate
  that 3.7.16 was a problematic release.  All of the bugs in 3.7.17 are 
  obscure and are unlikely to impact any particular application.  And most

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_16_2.html">version 3.7.16.2</a> fixes a long-standing flaw in the Windows
  OS interface that
  can result in database corruption under a rare race condition.
  See <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7ff3120e4f">http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7ff3120e4f</a> for a full description
  of the problem.</p>

<p>  As far as we know, this bug has never been seen in the wild.  The
  problem was discovered by the SQLite developers while writing stress tests
  for a separate component of SQLite.  Those stress tests have not yet
  found any problems with the component they were intended to verify, but 
  they did find the bug which is the subject of this patch release.</p>

<p>  Other than updates to version numbers, the only difference between this
  release and 3.7.16.1 is a two-character change in a single identifier,
  which is contained in the windows-specific OS interface logic.  There 
  are no changes in this release (other than version numbers) for platforms
  other than Windows.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_16_1.html">version 3.7.16.1</a> is a bug fix release that fixes a few problems
  that were present in the previous releases.</p>

<p>  The primary motivation for version 3.7.16.1 is to fix a bug in the
  query optimizer that was introduced as part of <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a>.  The
  query optimizer was being a little overzealous in optimizing out some
  ORDER BY clauses, which resulted in sorting being omitted on occasions
  where sorting is required to get the correct answer.  See
  ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/a179fe7465">a179fe7465</a> for

<p>  There was one important bug fix

  that addresses an incorrect query result that could have occurred in
  a three-way join where the join constraints compared INTEGER columns

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_12_12"></a><h3>2012-12-12 - Release 3.7.15</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_15.html">version 3.7.15</a> is a regularly schedule release of SQLite.  This
  release contains several improvements to the query planner and optimizer
  and one important bug fix.  This is the first release to officially
  support Windows 8 Phone.</p>

<p>  The important bug fix is a problem that can lead to segfaults when using
  <a href="sharedcache.html">shared cache mode</a> on a schema that contains a <a href="lang_expr.html#collateop">COLLATE operator</a> within
  a <a href="lang_createtable.html#ckconst">CHECK constraint</a> or within a <a href="lang_createview.html">view</a>.  Collating functions are associated
  with individual database connections.  But a pointer to the collating function
  was also being cached within expressions.  If an expression was part of the
  schema and contained a cached collating function, it would point to the
  collating function in the database connection that originally parsed the
  schema.  If that database connection closed while other database 
  connections using the same shared cache continued to operate, they other
  database connections would try to use the deallocated collating function
  in the database connection that closed.  The fix in version 3.7.15 was to
  not cache collating function pointers in the expression structure but 
  instead look them up each time a new statement is prepared.</p>

<p>  This release also contains some important enhancements to the query planner
  which should (we hope) make some queries run faster.  The enhancements
  include:</p>

<p>  <ol><li><p>When doing a full-table scan, try to use an index instead of
  the original table, under the theory that indices contain less information
  and are thus smaller and hence require less disk I/O to scan.</p></p>

<p>  <li><p>Enhance the <a href="lang_expr.html#in_op">IN operator</a> to allow it to make use of 
  indices that have <a href="datatype3.html#affinity">numeric affinity</a>.</p></p>

<p>  <li><p>Do a better job of recognizing when an ORDER BY clause can be 
  implemented using indices - especially in cases where the ORDER BY clause
  contains terms from two or more tables in a join.</p>
  </ol>

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_14_1.html">version 3.7.14.1</a> is a patch release.  Changes from the baseline
  version 3.7.14 are minimal and are restricted to fixing three bugs.</p>

<p>  One of the fixed bugs is a long-standing issue with the TCL interface.
  Another is an external compiler bug that SQLite merely works around and
  that only comes up if you are using the VisualStudio-2012 compiler to
  generate WinRT applications on ARM with optimizations enabled.  The
  third problem is an SQLite core bug, introduced in version 3.7.14, that
  can cause a segfault if a query contains a LEFT JOIN that contains an OR
  in the ON clause.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_09_03"></a><h3>2012-09-03 - Release 3.7.14</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_14.html">version 3.7.14</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release
  of SQLite.  The previous release continues to work well.  Upgrading
  is optional.</p>

<p>  Version 3.7.14 drops native support for OS/2.  We are not aware of any
  active projects that were using SQLite on OS/2 and since the SQLite
  developers had no way of testing on OS/2 it seemed like it was time
  to simply remove the OS/2 code from the SQLite tree.  If there are
  OS/2 projects out there that still need SQLite support, they can
  continue to maintain their own private <a href="vfs.html">VFS</a> which can be linked to
  SQLite at start-time using the <a href="c3ref/vfs_find.html">sqlite3_vfs_register()</a> interface.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/close.html">sqlite3_close_v2()</a> interface has been added.  The sqlite3_close_v2()
  interface differs from sqlite3_close() in that it is designed to work
  better for host language that use a garbage collector.  With the older
  sqlite3_close() interface, the associated <a href="c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statements</a> and
  <a href="c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> objects must be destroyed before the database connection.
  With the newer sqlite3_close_v2() interface, the objects can be destroyed
  in any order.</p>

<p>  This release also includes performance improvements to the sort algorithm
  that is used to implement ORDER BY and CREATE INDEX.  And the query planner
  has been enhanced to better use covering indices on queries that use OR
  terms in the WHERE clause.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2012_06_11"></a><h3>2012-06-11 - Release 3.7.13</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_13.html">version 3.7.13</a> adds support for WinRT and metro style
  applications for Microsoft Windows 8.  The 3.7.13 release is
  coming sooner than is usual after the previous release in order to get
  this new capability into the hands of developers.  To use SQLite in 
  a metro style application, compile with the -DSQLITE_OS_WINRT flag.
  Because of the increased application security and safety requirements
  of WinRT, all database
  filenames should be full pathnames.  Note that SQLite is not capable
  of accessing databases outside the installation directory and application
  data directory.  This restriction is another security and safety feature
  of WinRT. Apart from these restrictions, SQLite should work exactly
  the same on WinRT as it does on every other system.</p>

<p>  Also in this release: when a database is opened using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>
  and the <a href="uri.html#coreqp">mode=memory</a> query parameter 
  then the database is an in-memory database, just as if it had
  been named ":memory:".  But, if shared cache mode is enabled, then
  all other database connections that specify the same URI filename
  will connect to the same in-memory database.  This allows two or more
  database connections (in the same process) to share the same in-memory
  database.</p>

<p>  This release also includes some corner-case performance optimizations
  that are obscure yet significant to an important subset of SQLite users.
  Getting these performance optimizations into circulation quickly is
  yet another reason for making this release so soon following the previous.</p>

<p>  The next release of SQLite is scheduled to occur after the usual
  2 or 3 month interval.

<p>  The <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">PRAGMA cache_size</a> statement has been enhanced.  Formerly, you would
  use this statement to tell SQLite how many pages of the database files it
  should hold in its cache at once.  The total memory requirement would
  depend on the database page size. Now, if you give <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">PRAGMA cache_size</a>
  a negative value -N, it will allocate roughly N 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">kibibytes</a> of memory to cache,
  divided up according to page size.  This enhancement allows programs to
  more easily control their memory usage.</p>

<p>  There have been several obscure bug fixes.  One noteworthy bug,
  ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/ff5be73dee">ff5be73dee</a>,
  could in theory result in a corrupt database file if a power loss
  occurred at just the wrong moment on an unusually cantankerous disk
  drive.  But that is mostly a theoretical concern and is very unlikely
  to happen in practice.  The bug was found during laboratory testing
  and has never been observed to occur in the wild.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">version 3.7.9</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, 3.7.7.1, and 3.7.8 is optional.
  Upgrading from other versions is recommended.</p>

<p>  The <a href="compile.html#enable_stat2">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2</a> compile-time option is now a no-op.  The enhanced
  query-planner functionality formerly available using SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2
  is now available through <a href="compile.html#enable_stat3">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3</a>.  The enhanced query planning
  is still disabled by default.  However, future releases of SQLite might
  convert STAT3 from an enable-option to a disable-option so that it is 
  available by default and is only omitted upon request.</p>

<p>  The <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> full-text search engine has been enhanced such that tokens in
  the search string that begin with "&#94;" must be the first token in their
  respective columns in order to match.   Formerly, "&#94;" characters in the
  search string were simply ignored.  Hence, if a legacy application was
  including "&#94;" characters in FTS4 search strings, thinking that they would
  always be ignored, then those legacy applications might break with this
  update.  The fix is simply remove the "&#94;" characters from the search 
  string.</p>

<p>  See the <a href="releaselog/3_7_9.html">change summary</a> for additional changes associated
  with this release.  
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011__eptember_19"></a><h3>2011-September-19 - Version 3.7.8</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_8.html">version 3.7.8</a> is a quarterly maintenance release.  Upgrading from
  versions 3.7.6.3, 3.7.7, or 3.7.7.1 is optional.  Upgrading from other
  versions is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release features a new "external merge sort" algorithm used to
  implement ORDER BY and GROUP BY and also to presort the content of an
  index for CREATE INDEX.  The new algorithm does approximately the same
  number of comparisons and I/Os as before, but the I/Os are much more
  sequential and so runtimes are greatly reduced when the size of the
  set being sorted is larger than the filesystem cache.  The performance 
  improvement can be dramatic - orders of magnitude faster 
  for large CREATE INDEX commands.  On the other hand, 
  the code is slightly slower (1% or 2%)
  for a small CREATE INDEX.  Since CREATE INDEX is not an
  operation that commonly occurs on a speed-critical path, we feel that 
  this tradeoff is a good one.  The slight slowdown for small CREATE INDEX
  statements might be recovered in a future release.  ORDER BY and GROUP BY
  operations should now be faster for all cases, large and small.</p>

<p>  The query planner has been enhanced to do a better job of handling
  the DISTINCT keyword on SELECT statements.</p>

<p>  There has been a lot of work on the default <a href="vfs.html">VFSes</a>.  The unix VFS has
  been enhanced to include more overrideable system calls - a feature requested
  by Chromium to make it easier to build SQLite into a sandbox.  The
  windows VFS has been enhanced to be more resistant to interference from
  anti-virus software.</p>

<p>  Every version of SQLite is better tested than the previous, and 3.7.8
  is no exception to this rule.  Version 3.7.8 has been used internally by
  the SQLite team for mission critical functions and has performed flawlessly.
  And, of course, it passes our rigorous <a href="testing.html">testing</a> procedures with no
  problems detected.  Version 3.7.8 is recommended for all new development.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_7_1.html">version 3.7.7.1</a> adds a one-line bug fix to 3.7.7 to fix
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/25ee812710">a problem</a>
  causing <a href="pragma.html#pragma_case_sensitive_like">PRAGMA case_sensitive_like</a> statements compiled using the legacy
  <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> interface to fail with an <a href="rescode.html#schema">SQLITE_SCHEMA</a> error. Because
  <a href="c3ref/exec.html">sqlite3_exec()</a> uses sqlite3_prepare() internally, the problem also affects
  sqlite3_exec().</p>

<p>  Upgrading from 3.7.7 is only required for applications that use "PRAGMA
  case_sensitive_like" and the sqlite3_prepare() (or sqlite3_exec()) interface.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_06_24"></a><h3>2011-06-24 - Version 3.7.7</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_7.html">version 3.7.7</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release.  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3 is optional.  Upgrading from all
  prior releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release adds support for naming database files using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>.
  URI filenames are disabled by default (for backwards compatibility) but
  applications are encouraged to enable them since incompatibilities are
  likely to be exceedingly rare and the feature is useful.  See the 
  <a href="uri.html">URI filename documentation</a> for details.</p>

<p>  Most of the other enhancements in this release involve 
  <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a>.  The virtual table interface has been enhanced to
  support <a href="lang_savepoint.html">SAVEPOINT</a> and <a href="lang_conflict.html">ON CONFLICT</a> clause processing, and the built-in 
  <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> and <a href="fts3.html">FTS3/FTS4</a> have been augmented to take advantage of 
  the new capability.  This means, for example, that it is now possible
  to use the <a href="lang_replace.html">REPLACE</a> command on <a href="fts3.html">FTS3/FTS4</a> and <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> tables.</p>

<p>  The <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> full-text index extension has been enhanced to support
  the <a href="fts3.html#fts4prefix">FTS4 prefix option</a> and the <a href="fts3.html#fts4order">FTS4 order option</a>.  These two enhancements
  are provided in support of search-as-you-type interfaces where search
  results begin to appear after the first keystroke in the "search" box
  and are refined with each subsequent keystroke.  The way this is done is
  to do a separate full-text search after each key stroke, and add the
  "*" wildcard at the end of the word currently being typed.  So, for
  example, if the text typed so far is "fast da" and the next character
  typed is "t", then the application does a full-text search of the
  pattern "fast dat*" and displays the results.  Such capability has
  always existed.  What is new is that the <a href="fts3.html#fts4prefix">FTS4 prefix option</a> allows
  the search to be very fast (a matter of milliseconds) even for difficult
  cases such as "t*" or "th*".</p>

<p>  There has been a fair amount of work done on the FTS4 module for this
  release.  But the core SQLite code has changed little and the previous
  release has not given any problems, so we expect this to be a very
  stable release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011_05_19"></a><h3>2011-05-19 - Version 3.7.6.3</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_3.html">version 3.7.6.3</a> is a patch release that fixes a 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/2d1a5c67df">single bug</a>
  associated with <a href="wal.html">WAL mode</a>.  The bug has been in SQLite ever since WAL
  was added, but the problem is very obscure and so nobody has noticed
  before now.  Nevertheless, all users are encouraged to upgrade to
  version 3.7.6.3 or later.</p>

<p>  The bug is this:
  If the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> is set very small (less than 10) and SQLite comes
  under memory pressure and if a multi-statement transaction is started
  in which the last statement prior to COMMIT is a SELECT statement and if
  a <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> occurs right after the transaction commit, then
  it might happen that the transaction will be silently rolled back instead
  of being committed.</p>

<p>  The default setting for <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> is 2000. So in most situations, this
  bug will never appear.  But sometimes programmers set <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> to
  very small values on gadgets and other low-memory devices in order to
  save memory space.  Such applications are vulnerable.
  Note that this bug does <u>not</u> cause database corruption.  It is
  as if <a href="lang_transaction.html">ROLLBACK</a> were being run instead of <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a> in some cases.</p>

<p>  <b>Bug Details</b></p>

<p>  Transactions commit in WAL mode by adding a record onto the end of
  the WAL (the write-ahead log) that contains a "commit" flag.  So to
  commit a transaction, SQLite takes all the pages that have changed
  during that transaction, appends them to the WAL, and sets the commit
  flag on the last page.  Now, if SQLite comes under memory pressure, it
  might try to free up memory space by writing changed pages to the WAL
  prior to the commit.  We call this "spilling" the cache to WAL.  There 
  is nothing wrong with spilling cache to WAL.  But if the
  memory pressure is severe, it might be that by the time <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a> is run,
  all changed pages for the transaction have already been spilled to WAL
  and there are no pages left to be written to WAL.
  And with no unwritten pages, there was nothing to put the commit flag
  on.  And without a commit flag, the transaction would end up being
  rolled back.</p>

<p>  The fix to this problem was that if all changed pages has already
  been written to the WAL when the commit was started, then page 1 of
  the database will be written to the WAL again, so that there will always
  be a page available on which to set the commit flag.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_5.html">version 3.7.5</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Due to the discovery and fix of 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/tktview?name=5d863f876e">an obscure bug</a>
  that could cause database corruption, upgrading from all prior
  releases of SQLite is recommended.  This bug was found during code
  review and has not been observed in the wild.</p>

<p>  This release adds new <a href="c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatuslookasidehit">opcodes</a> for the
  <a href="c3ref/db_status.html">sqlite3_db_status()</a> interface that allow more precise measurement of

  for tuning in applications with very tight memory constraints.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_vsnprintf()</a> interface was added.  This routine is simply
  a varargs version of the long-standing <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_snprintf()</a> interface.</p>

  is optional.  Upgrading from all other SQLite releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release features <a href="fts3.html">full-text search</a> enhancements.  The older 
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> virtual table is still fully supported, and should also run
  faster.  In addition, the new <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> virtual table is added.  FTS4

  facilitates some performance improvements and more advanced 
  <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> output.  Look for further full-text search enhancements
  in subsequent releases.</p>

<p>  Also in this release, the <a href="eqp.html">EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</a> output has been enhanced

  more easily understand how SQLite is performing their queries.</p>

<p>  Thanks to an account from the folks at <a href="http://www.devio.us/">http://www.devio.us/</a>, OpenBSD

  The problem is fixed, of course, in this release.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_2.html">version 3.7.2</a> fixes a long-standing bug that can cause the
  database <a href="fileformat2.html#freelist">free-page list</a> to go corrupt if <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> is used
  multiple times to
  partially reduce the size of a database file that contains many hundreds
  of unused database pages.  The original bug reports together with links
  to the patch that fixes it can be seen 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/5e10420e8d">here</a>.</p>

<p>  This bug has been in the code for at least a year and possibly longer.
  The bug has nothing to do with the versions 3.7.1 or 3.7.0 or any other
  recent release.  The fact that the bug was discovered (and fixed)
  within hours of the 3.7.1 release is purely a coincidence.</p>

<p>  The bug is impossible to hit without using <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> and is
  very difficult to hit even with incremental_vacuum.  And the kind of
  corruption that the bug causes can usually be fixed 
  simply by running <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>.  Nevertheless, because the bug can result
  in database corruption, it is recommended that all SQLite users upgrade
  to version 3.7.2 or later.

  Other than the filesize-in-header bug that was fixed in <a href="releaselog/3_7_0_1.html">version 3.7.0.1</a>,
  no major problems have been seen in 3.7.0.  Some minor corner-case
  performance regressions have been fixed.  A typo in the OS/2 interface
  has been repaired.</p>

<p>  A biggest part of the 3.7.1 release is a cleanup and refactoring of
  the pager module within SQLite.  This refactoring should have no
  application-visible effects.  The purpose was to reorganize the code
  in ways that make it easier to prove correctness.</p>

<p>  The 3.7.1 release adds new experimental methods for obtained more 
  detailed memory usage information and for controlling database file
  fragmentation.  And the query planner now does a better job of
  optimizing the <a href="lang_expr.html#like">LIKE</a> and <a href="lang_expr.html#glob">GLOB</a> operators.</p>

<p>  This release increases the maximum size of database pages from 32KiB to
  64KiB.  A database with 64KiB pages will not be readable or writable by
  older versions of SQLite.  Note that further increases in page size
  are not feasible since the <a href="fileformat2.html">file format</a> uses 16-bit offsets to structures

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_21.html">version 3.6.21</a> focuses on performance optimization.  For
  a certain set of traces, this version uses 12% fewer CPU instructions
  than the previous release (as measured by Valgrind).  In addition, the
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> extension has been through an extensive cleanup and rework and
  the <a href="c3ref/profile.html">sqlite3_trace()</a> interface has been modified to insert 
  <a href="lang_expr.html#varparam">bound parameter</a> values into its output.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_11_04"></a><h3>2009-11-04 - Version 3.6.20</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_20.html">version 3.6.20</a> is a general maintenance release.  The
  query planner has been enhanced to work better with bound parameters
  in LIKE and GLOB operators and in range constraints and various minor
  bugs have been fixed.  Upgrading from 3.6.19 is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_10_14"></a><h3>2009-10-14 - Version 3.6.19</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_19.html">version 3.6.19</a> adds native support for
  <a href="foreignkeys.html">foreign key constraints</a>, including deferred constraints and
  cascading deletes.  Enforcement of foreign keys is disabled by
  default for backwards compatibility and must be turned on using
  the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys">foreign_keys pragma</a>.</p>

<p>  Version 3.6.19 also adds support for the
  <a href="lang_expr.html#isisnot">IS and IS NOT operators</a>.  Formerly, SQLite (as most
  other SQL database engines) supported IS NULL and IS NOT NULL.  The
  IS and IS NOT operators are generalizations that allow the right-hand
  side to be an arbitrary expression.  IS and IS NOT work the same as
  == (equals) and != (not equals) except that with IS and IS NOT the
  NULL values compare equal to one another.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_09_11"></a><h3>2009-09-11 - Version 3.6.18</h3><blockquote>
  Beginning with this release, the SQLite source code is tracked and
  managed using the <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>
  distributed configuration management system.  SQLite was previously
  versioned using CVS.  The entire CVS history has been imported into
  Fossil.  The older CVS repository remains on the website but is
  read-only.</p>

<p>  There are two major enhancements in SQLite version 3.6.18.  The first
  is a series or refinements to the query planner that help SQLite to
  choose better plans for joins where in the past it was selecting suboptimal
  query plans.  The <a href="compile.html#enable_stat2">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2</a> compile-time option has been
  added to cause SQLite to collect histogram data on indices when the
  <a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> command is run.  The use of histograms improve the query
  planning performance even more.</p>

<p>  The second major enhancement is that SQLite now support recursive
  triggers.  The older non-recursive behavior of triggers is still the
  default behavior.  Recursive triggers are activated using the
  <a href="pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers">recursive_triggers pragma</a>.  In addition to allowing triggers to
  call themselves (either directly or indirectly) the new capability
  also fires DELETE triggers on rows that are removed from a table
  as a result of <a href="lang_conflict.html">REPLACE</a> conflict resolution processing.</p>

<p>  Non-recursive triggers are still the default behavior since this
  is least likely to cause problems for existing applications.  However,
  we anticipate that triggers will become
  recursive by default beginning with release 3.7.0.  At that point,
  applications that want to continue using the older non-recursive
  trigger behavior will need to use the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers">recursive_triggers pragma</a>
  to disable recursive triggers.</p>

<p>  This version of SQLite also contains bug fixes, though none of the
  bugs are serious and all are obscure, so upgrading is optional.</p>

<p>  The SQLite core continues to have <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a>
  and so despite the many changes in this release, the developers 
  believe that this version of SQLite is stable and ready for production
  use.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_08_10"></a><h3>2009-08-10 - Version 3.6.17</h3><blockquote>
  This is a monthly maintenance release with a focus of bug fixes,
  performance improvements, and increased test coverage.  This is the
  first release of SQLite since <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a>
  was achieved on the SQLite core.  </p>

<p>  In addition, a new interface <a href="c3ref/stricmp.html">sqlite3_strnicmp()</a> is provided for the

  <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a> over the SQLite core
  (exclusive of the VFS backend and of extensions such as FTS3 and RTREE)
  when compiled for SuSE 10.1 Linux on x86.  The SQLite developers pledge
  to maintain branch test coverage at 100% in all future releases.
  Ongoing work will strive for 100% branch test coverage on the 
  operating-system backends and extensions as well.

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_05_25"></a><h3>2009-05-25 - Version 3.6.14.2</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_2.html">version 3.6.14.2</a> fixes an obscure bug in the code generator
  (ticket #3879)
  section of SQLite which can potentially cause incorrect query results.
  The changes from the prior release consist of only this one bug fix,
  check-in [6676]
  and a change to the version number text.</p>

<p>  The bug was introduced in version 3.6.14.  It is recommended that
  users of version 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1 upgrade to this release.  Applications
  are unlikely to hit this bug, but since it is difficult to predict which
  applications might hit it and which might not, we recommend that all
  users of 3.6.14 and 3.5.14.1 upgrade to this release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_05_19"></a><h3>2009-05-19 - Version 3.6.14.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_1.html">version 3.6.14.1</a> is a patch release to <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">version 3.6.14</a> with
  minimal changes that fixes three bugs.  Upgrading is only necessary 
  for users who are impacted by one or more of those bugs.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009_05_07"></a><h3>2009-05-07 - Version 3.6.14</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">version 3.6.14</a> provides new performance enhancements in
  the btree and pager layers and in the query optimizer.  Certain
  workloads can be as much as twice as fast as the previous release,
  though 10% faster is a more typical result.</p>

<p>  Queries against <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a> that contain OR and IN operators
  in the WHERE clause are now able to use indexing.</p>

<p>  A new optional <a href="asyncvfs.html">asynchronous I/O backend</a> is available for
  unix and windows.  The asynchronous backend gives the illusion of faster
  response time by pushing slow write operations into a background thread.
  The tradeoff for faster response time is that more memory is required
  (to hold the content of the pending writes) and if a power failure or
  program crash occurs, some transactions that appeared to have committed
  might end up being rolled back upon restart.</p>

<p>  This release also contains many minor bug fixes, documentation enhancements,
  new test cases, and cleanups and simplifications to the source code.</p>

<p>  There is no compelling reason to upgrade from versions 3.6.12 or
  3.6.13 if those prior versions are working.  Though many users may
  benefit from the improved performance.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008_12_16"></a><h3>2008-12-16 - Version 3.6.7</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_7.html">version 3.6.7</a> contains a major cleanup of the Unix driver,
  and support for the new Proxy Locking mechanism on Mac OS X.  Though
  the Unix driver is reorganized, its functionality is the same and so
  applications should not notice a difference.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008_11_26"></a><h3>2008-11-26 - Version 3.6.6.2</h3><blockquote>
  This release fixes a bug that was introduced into SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_6.html">version 3.6.6</a>
  and which seems like it might be able to cause database corruption.  This
  bug was detected during stress testing.  It has not been seen in the wild.
  An analysis of the problem suggests that the bug might be able to cause
  database corruption, however focused efforts to find a real-world test
  cases that actually causes database corruption have so far been unsuccessful.
  Hence, the likelihood of this bug causing problems is low.  Nevertheless,
  we have decided to do an emergency branch release out of an abundance of
  caution.</p>

<p>  The <a href="releaselog/3_6_6_2.html">version 3.6.6.2</a> release also fixes an obscure memory leak that
  can occur following a disk I/O error.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008_11_22"></a><h3>2008-11-22 - Version 3.6.6.1</h3><blockquote>
  This release fixes a bug that was introduced into SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_4.html">version 3.6.4</a>
  and that can cause database corruption in obscure cases.  This bug has
  never been seen in the wild; it was first detected by internal stress
  tests and required substantial analysis before it could be shown to 
  potentially lead to corruption.  So we feel that SQLite versions 3.6.4,
  3.6.5, and 3.6.6 are safe to use for development work.  But upgrading
  to this patch release or later is recommended prior to deploying
  products that incorporate SQLite.</p>

<p>  We have taken the unusual step of issuing a patch release in order to
  get the fix for this bug into circulation quickly.  SQLite version 3.6.7
  will continue on its normal path of development with an anticipated
  release in mid December.

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008_05_12"></a><h3>2008-05-12 - Version 3.5.9</h3><blockquote>
  Version 3.5.9 adds a new experimental <a href="pragma.html#syntax">PRAGMA</a>: <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">journal_mode</a>.
  Setting the journal mode to PERSIST can provide performance improvement

  mode is still considered experimental and should be used with caution
  pending further testing.</p>

<p>  Version 3.5.9 is intended to be the last stable release prior to

  APIs are subject to change in a future release.  This release is
  mostly to make available the minor bug fixes that have accumulated
  since 3.3.6.  Upgrading is not necessary.  Do so only if you encounter
  one of the obscure bugs that have been fixed or if you want to try
  out the new features.

  Many bugs found in last week's alpha release have now been fixed and
  the library is running much faster again.</p>

<p>  Database connections can now be moved between threads as long as the
  connection holds no locks at the time it is moved.  Thus the common
  paradigm of maintaining a pool of database connections and handing
  them off to transient worker threads is now supported.
  Please help test this new feature.
  See the MultiThreading wiki page for additional
  information.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2006_01_10"></a><h3>2006-01-10 - Version 3.3.0 alpha</h3><blockquote>
  Version 3.3.0 adds support for CHECK constraints, DESC indices,
  separate REAL and INTEGER column affinities, a new OS interface layer
  design, and many other changes.  The code passed a regression
  test but should still be considered alpha.  Please report any
  problems.</p>

<p>  The file format for version 3.3.0 has changed slightly to support
  descending indices and
  a more efficient encoding of boolean values.  SQLite 3.3.0 will read and
  write legacy databases created with any prior version of SQLite 3.  But
  databases created by version 3.3.0 will not be readable or writable
  by earlier versions of the SQLite.  The older file format can be
  specified at compile-time for those rare cases where it is needed.

  That bug might possibly cause database corruption if a large INSERT or
  UPDATE statement within a multi-statement transaction fails due to a
  uniqueness constraint but the containing transaction commits.

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2005_09_16"></a><h3>2005-09-16 - Version 3.2.6 - Critical Bug Fix</h3><blockquote>
  This version fixes a bug that can result in database
  corruption if a VACUUM of a 1 gigabyte or larger database fails
  (perhaps do to running out of disk space or an unexpected power loss)
  and is later rolled back.
  <p>
  Also in this release:
  The ORDER BY and GROUP BY processing was rewritten to use less memory.
  Support for COUNT(DISTINCT) was added.  The LIKE operator can now be
  used by the optimizer on columns with COLLATE NOCASE.

  are having problems or unless you just want to.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2005_03_29"></a><h3>2005-03-29 - Version 3.2.1</h3><blockquote>

<p>  Version 3.2.0 also fixes an obscure but serious bug that was discovered
  just prior to release.  If you have a multi-statement transaction and
  within that transaction an UPDATE or INSERT statement fails due to a
  constraint, then you try to rollback the whole transaction, the rollback
  might not work correctly.  See

  introduced in version 3.0.0.  See
  Ticket #1163 for additional information.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2005_03_11"></a><h3>2005-03-11 - Versions 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 Released</h3><blockquote>
  Version 3.1.4 fixes a critical bug that could cause database corruption
  if the autovacuum mode of version 3.1.0 is turned on (it is off by
  default) and a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX is executed within a transaction but
  fails because the indexed columns are not unique.  Anyone using the
  autovacuum feature and unique indices should upgrade.</p>

<p>  Version 3.1.5 adds the ability to disable
  the F_FULLFSYNC ioctl() in OS-X by setting "PRAGMA synchronous=on" instead
  of the default "PRAGMA synchronous=full".  There was an attempt to add
  this capability in 3.1.4 but it did not work due to a spelling error.

  A critical bug in the VACUUM command that can lead to database
  corruption has been fixed in both the 2.x branch and the main
  3.x line.  This bug has existed in all prior versions of SQLite.
  Even though it is unlikely you will ever encounter this bug,
  it is suggested that all users upgrade.  See
  ticket #1116 for additional information.</p>

<p>  Version 3.1.2 is also the first stable release of the 3.1
  series.  SQLite 3.1 features added support for correlated

  through the use of UTF-16 and user-defined text collating sequences.
  BLOBs can now be stored directly, without encoding.
  A new file format results in databases that are 25% smaller (depending
  on content).  The code is also a little faster.  In spite of the many
  new features, the library footprint is still less than 240KB
