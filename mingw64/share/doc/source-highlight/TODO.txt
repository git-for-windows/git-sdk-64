TODO list
=========

test for always flush (together with line number), and command line option

use <ol> lists and css for changing colors of lines,
see http://shiflett.org/code/highlight.php

shjs_css_transform.sh in share

background color in some .css in doc (for TODO)

the default ctags command line option should contain the
actual found ctags

line numbers in table in a smarter way, so that code is separated by lines
(different columns).

CODE CLEANUP

the style file is always parsed even for output formats that don't need it...
but how to infer whether the style must be read or not?
IMPORTANT: this is crucial for output generation such as CSS that produces
elements with the class syntax: if that element is not in the style file that
element will be generated with class normal but this is not really correct...

GROUPS

also string def as StringDef

Is there an element class that is not a StateStartLangElem?

check empty alternative in string def: "foo||" which would lead
to a non-terminating program

LANG FILES
----------
recognize kde rc files

LIBRARY
---------------
- RegexPreprocessor should not contain code dealing with boost::regex?

- in LineRule is it really required to put the [^...]?

- use also line prefix in order to write line number in a different column
than the source highlighted code.

- outputfilename and outputfilename extension do not concern the formatter?
the only thing that should be passed to format() should be linenumber and filename?
  - why refentry.filename == fileinfo->filename || refentry.filename
                    == fileinfo->input_file_name) also input_file_name (no path)?
                    
- line numbers and code in different columns when generating tables (probably use
linesuffix)?

- ctags:
  Are the input and output file useful in ctagsformatter?  Or could we put it into
  FormatterParams?

LIBRARY

- use namespaces (for copyright and reportbugs?)
- class for parsers (or for langdefparserfun.h) in order to use namespaces
- document LangElem

- should library headers use <srchilite/...> ?
- who calls createMissingFormatter?

Configuration: a class with data dir, LangMap, keep all the related
objects consistent: e.g., if we change dataDir, then change it also in 
lang map objects. (?)

move .lang, .outlang and others in another directory?

Makefile.lang:
- add VAR += VALUE and -= VALUE

remove @author in files (and check doxygen documentation)

Java annotations @Override, etc.?

accept rgb colors in the style and .outlang can
express a way to use the colors in this format

TextStyleFormatterFactory: PreFormatter is never used!

3.1.2

improve source-highlight-settings interface
add help and some command lines (--show)

in less handle file names with spaces (use " ?)

increment x:X:x for library (languageinfer.cpp)

string delim "\"" '\"(c|w|d)' build a multiline regex!

  rule (string) "`(?:[^`])*`" (exit level: 0, next: 0)
  rule (string) "\"" (exit level: 0, next: 4)
    STATE 4 default: string
      rule (string) "\"(?:c|w|d)" (exit level: 1, next: 0)

move .lang, .outlang, .map, etc in a share directory
in source folder, together with style and css files.

in this case

df =
include "c_comment.lang"

reports as file name error c_comment.lang!

if the included file cannot be found it does not report an error?

QMAKE
-----
ABSOLUTEDATADIR=\\\"/usr/local\\\" make it configurable

PREFIX variable to pass to qmake

texinfo generate html and put in the doc source folder

common.pri for files in src

LANGUAGES

doxygen
doxygen in C/C++ (\ syntax)

deal with php in html title and other special cases

qmake .pro and .pri files

.ini files (e.g., php.ini) comment lines start with ;

in latex.outlang
"~" "{\\raise.17ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\\sim$}}"

texinfo generated files in the doc source folder

BEFORE RELEASING

remember to update the version and library version in
defines.pri

remember to update the version in .directive
