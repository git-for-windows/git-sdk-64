# 
# So our job here is to (a) find the awk interpreter,
# and (b) find the texindex.awk script file.

# Suppose a symlink named a\tb (four chars) is made to this script, and
# "a\tb" --help
# is invoked.  We want the output to report the program name as the
# four chars a, \, t, b, not a, tab, b.
# 
# But we pass the value using (g)awk -v, and (g)awk processes arguments
# to -v for escape sequences, so that by the time the rest of the script
# sees it, it has a tab in it.
# 
# Conclusion: we must double any backslashes before invoking gawk,
# by running the command: sed 's,\\,\\\\,g'
# 
# Sadly, since we have to do this in a shell, we need twice
# as many backslash characters in the input.  Hope it's portable across
# shells and seds.
