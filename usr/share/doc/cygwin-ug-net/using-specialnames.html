read by Cygwin before the mount table has been established.  The list
of files is</p><pre class="screen">
  /etc/fstab
  /etc/fstab.d/$USER
  /etc/passwd
  /etc/group
</pre><p>These file are read using native Windows NT functions which have
no notion of Cygwin symlinks or POSIX paths.  For that reason
there are a few requirements as far as <code class="filename">/etc</code> is
concerned.</p><p>To access these files, the Cygwin DLL evaluates it's own full
Windows path, strips off the innermost directory component and adds
"\etc".  Let's assume the Cygwin DLL is installed as
<code class="filename">C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</code>.  First the DLL name as
well as the innermost directory (<code class="filename">bin</code>) is stripped
off: <code class="filename">C:\cygwin\</code>.  Then "etc" and the filename to
look for is attached: <code class="filename">C:\cygwin\etc\fstab</code>.  So the
/etc directory must be parallel to the directory in which the cygwin1.dll
exists and <code class="filename">/etc</code> must not be a Cygwin symlink
pointing to another directory.  Consequentially none of the files from
the above list, including the directory <code class="filename">/etc/fstab.d</code>
is allowed to be a Cygwin symlink either.</p><p>However, native NTFS symlinks and reparse points are transparent
when accessing the above files so all these files as well as
<code class="filename">/etc</code> itself may be NTFS symlinks.</p><p>Last but not least, make sure that these files are world-readable.
Every process of any user account has to read these files potentially,
so world-readability is essential.  The only exception are the user
specific files <code class="filename">/etc/fstab.d/$USER</code>, which only have
to be readable by the $USER user account itself.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-dosdevices"></a>Invalid filenames</h3></div></div></div><p>Filenames invalid under Win32 are not necessarily invalid under Cygwin.
There are a few rules which apply to Windows filenames.  Most notably, DOS
device names like <code class="filename">AUX</code>, <code class="filename">COM1</code>,
<code class="filename">LPT1</code> or <code class="filename">PRN</code> (to name a few)
cannot be used as filename or extension in a native Win32 application.
So filenames like <code class="filename">prn.txt</code> or <code class="filename">foo.aux</code>
are invalid filenames for native Win32 applications.</p><p>This restriction doesn't apply to Cygwin applications.  Cygwin
can create and access files with such names just fine.  Just don't try
to use these files with native Win32 applications.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-specialchars"></a>Forbidden characters in filenames</h3></div></div></div><p>Some characters are disallowed in filenames on Windows filesystems.
These forbidden characters are the ASCII control characters from ASCII
value 1 to 31, plus the following characters which have a special meaning
in the Win32 API:</p><pre class="screen">
  "   *   :   &lt;   &gt;   ?   |   \
</pre><p>Cygwin can't fix this, but it has a method to workaround this
restriction.  All of the above characters, except for the backslash,
are converted to special UNICODE characters in the range 0xf000 to 0xf0ff
(the "Private use area") when creating or accessing files by adding 0xf000
to the forbidden characters' code points.</p><p>The backslash has to be exempt from this conversion, because Cygwin
accepts Win32 filenames including backslashes as path separators on input. 
Converting backslashes using the above method would make this impossible.</p><p>Additionally Win32 filenames can't contain trailing dots and spaces
for DOS backward compatibility.  When trying to create files with trailing
dots or spaces, all of them are removed before the file is created.  This
restriction only affects native Win32 applications.  Cygwin applications
can create and access files with trailing dots and spaces without problems.
</p><p>An exception from this rule are some network filesystems (NetApp,
NWFS) which choke on these filenames.  They return with an error like
"No such file or directory" when trying to create such files.  Cygwin
recognizes these filesystems and works around this problem by applying
the same rule as for the other forbidden characters.  Leading spaces and
trailing dots and spaces will be converted to UNICODE characters in the
private use area.  This behaviour can be switched on explicitely for a
filesystem or a directory tree by using the mount option
<code class="literal">dos</code>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-unusual"></a>Filenames with unusual (foreign) characters</h3></div></div></div><p> Windows filesystems use Unicode encoded as UTF-16
to store filename information.  If you don't use the UTF-8
character set (see <a class="xref" href="setup-locale.html" title="Internationalization">the section called &#8220;Internationalization&#8221;</a>) then there's a
chance that a filename is using one or more characters which have no
representation in the character set you're using.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In the default "C" locale, Cygwin creates filenames using
the UTF-8 charset.  This will always result in some valid filename by
default, but again might impose problems when switching to a non-"C"
or non-"UTF-8" charset.</p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>To avoid this scenario altogether, always use UTF-8 as the
character set.</p></div><p>If you don't want or can't use UTF-8 as character set for whatever
reason, you will nevertheless be able to access the file.  How does that
work?  When Cygwin converts the filename from UTF-16 to your character
set, it recognizes characters which can't be converted.  If that occurs,
Cygwin replaces the non-convertible character with a special character
sequence.  The sequence starts with an ASCII CAN character (hex code
0x18, equivalent Control-X), followed by the UTF-8 representation of the
character.  The result is a filename containing some ugly looking
characters.  While it doesn't <span class="bold"><strong>look</strong></span> nice, it
<span class="bold"><strong>is</strong></span> nice, because Cygwin knows how to convert
this filename back to UTF-16.  The filename will be converted using your
usual character set.  However, when Cygwin recognizes an ASCII CAN
character, it skips over the ASCII CAN and handles the following bytes as
a UTF-8 character.  Thus, the filename is symmetrically converted back to
UTF-16 and you can access the file.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Please be aware that this method is not entirely foolproof.
In some character set combinations it might not work for certain native
characters.</p><p>Only by using the UTF-8 charset you can avoid this problem safely.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-casesensitive"></a>Case sensitive filenames</h3></div></div></div><p>In the Win32 subsystem filenames are only case-preserved, but not
case-sensitive.  You can't access two files in the same directory which
only differ by case, like <code class="filename">Abc</code> and
<code class="filename">aBc</code>.  While NTFS (and some remote filesystems)
support case-sensitivity, the NT kernel does not support it by default.
Rather, you have to tweak a registry setting and reboot.  For that reason,
case-sensitivity can not be supported by Cygwin, unless you change that
registry value.</p><p>If you really want case-sensitivity in Cygwin, you can switch it
on by setting the registry value</p><pre class="screen">
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel\obcaseinsensitive
</pre><p>to 0 and reboot the machine.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
When installing Microsoft's Services For Unix (SFU), you're asked if
you want to use case-sensitive filenames.  If you answer "yes" at this point,
the installer will change the aforementioned registry value to 0, too.  So, if
you have SFU installed, there's some chance that the registry value is already
set to case sensitivity.
</p></div><p>After you set this registry value to 0, Cygwin will be case-sensitive
by default on NTFS and NFS filesystems.  However, there are limitations: 
while two <span class="bold"><strong>programs</strong></span> <code class="filename">Abc.exe</code>
and <code class="filename">aBc.exe</code> can be created and accessed like other files,
starting applications is still case-insensitive due to Windows limitations
and so the program you try to launch may not be the one actually started.  Also,
be aware that using two filenames which only differ by case might
result in some weird interoperability issues with native Win32 applications.  
You're using case-sensitivity at your own risk.  You have been warned! </p><p>Even if you use case-sensitivity, it might be feasible to switch to
case-insensitivity for certain paths for better interoperability with
native Win32 applications (even if it's just Windows Explorer).  You can do
this on a per-mount point base, by using the "posix=0" mount option in
<code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code>, or your <code class="filename">/etc/fstab.d/$USER</code>
file.</p><p><code class="filename">/cygdrive</code> paths are case-insensitive by default.
The reason is that the native Windows %PATH% environment variable is not
always using the correct case for all paths in it.  As a result, if you use
case-sensitivity on the <code class="filename">/cygdrive</code> prefix, your shell
might claim that it can't find Windows commands like <span class="command"><strong>attrib</strong></span>
or <span class="command"><strong>net</strong></span>.  To ease the pain, the <code class="filename">/cygdrive</code>
path is case-insensitive by default and you have to use the "posix=1" setting
explicitly in <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> or
<code class="filename">/etc/fstab.d/$USER</code> to switch it to case-sensitivity,
or you have to make sure that the native Win32 %PATH% environment variable
is using the correct case for all paths throughout.</p><p>Note that mount points as well as device names and virtual
paths like /proc are always case-sensitive!  The only exception are
the subdirectories and filenames under /proc/registry, /proc/registry32
and /proc/registry64.  Registry access is always case-insensitive.
Read on for more information.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-casesensitivedirs"></a>Case sensitive directories</h3></div></div></div><p>Windows 10 1803 introduced a new feature: NTFS directories can be marked
as case-sensitive, independently of the <code class="literal">obcaseinsensitive</code>
registry key discussed in the previous section.  This new per-directory
case-sensitivity requires setting a flag in the NTFS filesystem header which
is, unfortunately, undocumented.  The result is that you have to activate
<code class="literal">Windows Subsystem for Linux</code> (<code class="literal">WSL</code>), a
feature available via <code class="literal">Programs and Features</code> -&gt;
<code class="literal">Turn Windows features on or off</code>.  You only have to activate
<code class="literal">WSL</code>, you don't have to install any actual Linux.  After
turning <code class="literal">WSL</code> on and performing the compulsory reboot,
case-sensitive directories are activated.</p><p>Of course, there's a drawback.  While these case-sensitive directories
work like charm on the local machine, there are massive interoperability
problems when trying to access these directories from remote machines at
the time of writing this.  We opened a bug report for that at
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3885" target="_top">Microsoft's WSL issue tracker</a>,
if you're interested in the details.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you want case-sensitivity and need interoperability with remote
machines, better stick to switching the kernel to case-sensitivity as
outlined in <a class="xref" href="using-specialnames.html#pathnames-casesensitive" title="Case sensitive filenames">the section called &#8220;Case sensitive filenames&#8221;</a></p></div><p>With <code class="literal">WSL</code> activated and starting with Cygwin 3.0.0,
Cygwin's <span class="command"><strong>mkdir</strong></span> system call automatically created all
directories below the Cygwin installation directory as case-sensitive.
With Cygwin 3.0.2, this feature had been disabled again for hopefully
obvious reasons.</p><p>However, you can still use Cygwin's new

to control case-sensitivity of directories on NTFS filesystems.</p><p>Please keep in mind that switching <span class="emphasis"><em>off</em></span>
case-sensitivity on a directory has a condition attached to it:  If
the directory contains two files which only differ in case (e. g.,
<code class="filename">foo</code> and <code class="filename">FOO</code>), Windows
refuses to convert the dir back to case-insensitive.  First you have
to fix the filename collision, i. e., you have to rename one of these
files.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pathnames-posixdevices"></a>POSIX devices</h3></div></div></div><p>While there is no need to create a POSIX <code class="filename">/dev</code> 
directory, the directory is automatically created as part of a Cygwin
installation.  It's existence is often a prerequisit to run certain
applications which create symbolic links, fifos, or UNIX sockets in
<code class="filename">/dev</code>.  Also, the directories <code class="filename">/dev/shm</code>
and <code class="filename">/dev/mqueue</code> are required to exist to use named POSIX
semaphores, shared memory, and message queues, so a system without a real
<code class="filename">/dev</code> directory is functionally crippled.
</p><p>Apart from that, Cygwin automatically simulates POSIX devices
internally.  The <code class="filename">/dev</code> directory is automagically
populated with existing POSIX devices by Cygwin in a way comparable with a
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev" target="_top">udev</a> based virtual
<code class="filename">/dev</code> directory under Linux.</p><p>
Cygwin supports the following character devices commonly found on POSIX systems:
</p><pre class="screen">
/dev/null
/dev/zero
/dev/full

/dev/console	Pseudo device name for the current console window of a session.
		Cygwin's /dev/console is not quite comparable with the console
		device on UNIX machines.

/dev/cons0      Console sessions are numbered from  /dev/cons0 upwards.
/dev/cons1	Console device names are pseudo device names, only accessible
...		from processes within this very console session.  This is due
		to a restriction in Windows.

/dev/tty	The current controlling tty of a session.

/dev/ptmx	Pseudo tty master device.

/dev/pty0	Pseudo ttys are numbered from /dev/pty0 upwards as they are
/dev/pty1	requested.
...

/dev/ttyS0	Serial communication devices.  ttyS0 == Win32 COM1,
/dev/ttyS1	ttyS1 == COM2, etc.
...

/dev/pipe
/dev/fifo

/dev/kmsg	Kernel message pipe, for usage with sys logger services.

/dev/random	Random number generator.
/dev/urandom

/dev/dsp	Default sound device of the system.
</pre><p>
Cygwin also has several Windows-specific devices:
</p><pre class="screen">
/dev/com1	The serial ports, starting with COM1 which is the same as ttyS0.
/dev/com2	Please use /dev/ttySx instead.
...

/dev/conin	Same as Windows CONIN$.
/dev/conout	Same as Windows CONOUT$.
/dev/clipboard	The Windows clipboard, text only
/dev/windows	The Windows message queue.
</pre><p>
Block devices are accessible by Cygwin processes using fixed POSIX device
names.  These POSIX device names are generated using a direct conversion
from the POSIX namespace to the internal NT namespace.
E.g. the first harddisk is the NT internal device \device\harddisk0\partition0
or the first partition on the third harddisk is \device\harddisk2\partition1.
The first floppy in the system is \device\floppy0, the first CD-ROM is
\device\cdrom0 and the first tape drive is \device\tape0.</p><p>The mapping from physical device to the name of the device in the
internal NT namespace can be found in various places.  For hard disks and
CD/DVD drives, the Windows "Disk Management" utility (part of the
"Computer Management" console) shows that the mapping of "Disk 0" is
\device\harddisk0.  "CD-ROM 2" is \device\cdrom2.  Another place to find
this mapping is the "Device Management" console.  Disks have a
"Location" number, tapes have a "Tape Symbolic Name", etc.
Unfortunately, the places where this information is found is not very
well-defined.</p><p>
For external disks (USB-drives, CF-cards in a cardreader, etc) you can use
Cygwin to show the mapping.  <code class="filename">/proc/partitions</code>
contains a list of raw drives known to Cygwin.  The <span class="command"><strong>df</strong></span>
command shows a list of drives and their respective sizes.  If you match
the information between <code class="filename">/proc/partitions</code> and the
<span class="command"><strong>df</strong></span> output, you should be able to figure out which
external drive corresponds to which raw disk device name.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Apart from tape devices which are not block devices and are
