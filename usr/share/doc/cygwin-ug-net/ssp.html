</pre></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="ssp-desc"></a><h2>Description</h2><p> The SSP is a program that uses the Win32 debug API to run a program
      one ASM instruction at a time. It records the location of each
      instruction used, how many times that instruction is used, and all
      function calls. The results are saved in a format that is usable by the
      profiling program <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span>, although
      <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> will claim the values are seconds, they really
      are instruction counts. More on that later. </p><p>(See also <span class="command"><strong>profiler</strong></span>, another profiler that
      operates in a different fashion: IP sampling. This can provide a
      different view on your program's operation.)</p><p> Because the SSP was originally designed to profile the Cygwin DLL,
      it does not automatically select a block of code to report statistics on.
      You must specify the range of memory addresses to keep track of manually,
      but it's not hard to figure out what to specify. Use the "objdump"
      program to determine the bounds of the target's ".text" section. Let's
      say we're profiling cygwin1.dll. Make sure you've built it with debug
      symbols (else <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> won't run) and run objdump like
      this: </p><pre class="screen">
$ objdump -h cygwin1.dll
</pre><p> It will print a report
      like this:
      </p><pre class="screen">
cygwin1.dll:     file format pei-i386

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
  0 .text         0007ea00  61001000  61001000  00000400  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE, DATA
  1 .data         00008000  61080000  61080000  0007ee00  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  . . .
</pre><p> </p><p> The only information we're concerned with are the VMA of the .text
      section and the VMA of the section after it (sections are usually
      contiguous; you can also add the Size to the VMA to get the end address).
      In this case, the VMA is 0x61001000 and the ending address is either
      0x61080000 (start of .data method) or 0x6107fa00 (VMA+Size method). </p><p> There are two basic ways to use SSP - either profiling a whole
      program, or selectively profiling parts of the program. </p><p> To profile a whole program, just run <span class="command"><strong>ssp</strong></span> without
      options. By default, it will step the whole program. Here's a simple
      example, using the numbers above:
      </p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
</pre><p> This will step
      the whole program. It will take at least 8 minutes on a PII/300 (yes,
      really). When it's done, it will create a file called "gmon.out". You can
      turn this data file into a readable report with <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span>:
      </p><pre class="screen">
$ gprof -b cygwin1.dll
</pre><p> The "-b" means 'skip the help
      pages'. You can omit this until you're familiar with the report layout.
      The <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> documentation explains a lot about this
      report, but <span class="command"><strong>ssp</strong></span> changes a few things. For example, the
      first part of the report reports the amount of time spent in each
      function, like this:
      </p><pre class="screen">
Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls  ms/call  ms/call  name
 10.02    231.22    72.43       46  1574.57  1574.57  strcspn
  7.95    288.70    57.48      130   442.15   442.15  strncasematch
</pre><p>
      The "seconds" columns are really CPU opcodes, 1/100 second per opcode.
      So, "231.22" above means 23,122 opcodes. The ms/call values are 10x too
      big; 1574.57 means 157.457 opcodes per call. Similar adjustments need to
      be made for the "self" and "children" columns in the second part of the
      report. </p><p> OK, so now we've got a huge report that took a long time to
      generate, and we've identified a spot we want to work on optimizing.
      Let's say it's the time() function. We can use SSP to selectively profile
      this function by using OutputDebugString() to control SSP from within the
      program. Here's a sample program:
      </p><pre class="screen">
	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
	main()
	{
	  time_t t;
	  OutputDebugString("ssp on");
	  time(&amp;t);
	  OutputDebugString("ssp off");
	}
</pre><p> </p><p> Then, add the <code class="literal">-d</code> option to ssp to default to
      *disabling* profiling. The program will run at full speed until the first
      OutputDebugString, then step until the second. You can then use
      <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> (as usual) to see the performance profile for
      just that portion of the program's execution. </p><p> There are many options to ssp. Since step-profiling makes your
      program run about 1,000 times slower than normal, it's best to understand
      all the options so that you can narrow down the parts of your program you
      need to single-step. </p><p> <code class="literal">-v</code> - verbose. This prints messages about threads
      starting and stopping, OutputDebugString calls, DLLs loading, etc. </p><p> <code class="literal">-t</code> and <code class="literal">-c</code> - tracing. With
      <code class="literal">-t</code>, *every* step's address is written to the file
      "trace.ssp". This can be used to help debug functions, since it can trace
      multiple threads. Clever use of scripts can match addresses with
      disassembled opcodes if needed. Warning: creates *huge* files, very
      quickly. <code class="literal">-c</code> prints each address to the console, useful
      for debugging key chunks of assembler. Use <code class="literal">addr2line -C -f -s -e
      foo.exe &lt; trace.ssp &gt; lines.ssp</code> and then <code class="literal">perl
      cvttrace</code> to convert to symbolic traces. </p><p> <code class="literal">-s</code> - subthreads. Usually, you only need to trace
      the main thread, but sometimes you need to trace all threads, so this
      enables that. It's also needed when you want to profile a function that
      only a subthread calls. However, using OutputDebugString automatically
      enables profiling on the thread that called it, not the main thread. </p><p> <code class="literal">-l</code> - dll profiling. Generates a pretty table of
      how much time was spent in each dll the program used. No sense optimizing
      a function in your program if most of the time is spent in the DLL. I
      usually use the <code class="literal">-v</code>, <code class="literal">-s</code>, and
      <code class="literal">-l</code> options:
      </p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp <code class="literal">-v</code> <code class="literal">-s</code> <code class="literal">-l</code> <code class="literal">-d</code> 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
