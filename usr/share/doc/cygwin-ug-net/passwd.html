User operations:
  -l, --lock               lock USER's account.
  -u, --unlock             unlock USER's account.
  -c, --cannot-change      USER can't change password.
  -C, --can-change         USER can change password.
  -e, --never-expires      USER's password never expires.
  -E, --expires            USER's password expires according to system's
                           password aging rule.
  -p, --pwd-not-required   no password required for USER.
  -P, --pwd-required       password is required for USER.
  -R, --reg-store-pwd      enter password to store it in the registry for
                           later usage by services to be able to switch
                           to this user context with network credentials.

System operations:
  -i, --inactive NUM       set NUM of days before inactive accounts are disabled
                           (inactive accounts are those with expired passwords).
  -n, --minage MINDAYS     set system minimum password age to MINDAYS days.
  -x, --maxage MAXDAYS     set system maximum password age to MAXDAYS days.
  -L, --length LEN         set system minimum password length to LEN.

Other options:
  -d, --logonserver SERVER connect to SERVER (e.g. domain controller).
                           Usually not required.
  -S, --status             display password status for USER (locked, expired,
                           etc.) plus global system password settings.
  -h, --help               output usage information and exit.
  -V, --version            output version information and exit.

If no option is given, change USER's password.  If no user name is given,
operate on current user.  System operations must not be mixed with user
operations.  Don't specify a USER when triggering a system operation.

Don't specify a user or any other option together with the -R option.
Non-Admin users can only store their password if cygserver is running.
Note that storing even obfuscated passwords in the registry is not overly
secure.  Use this feature only if the machine is adequately locked down.
Don't use this feature if you don't need network access within a remote
session.  You can delete your stored password by using `passwd -R' and
specifying an empty password.
</pre></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="passwd-desc"></a><h2>Description</h2><p> <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> changes passwords for user accounts. A
      normal user may only change the password for their own account, but
      administrators may change passwords on any account.
      <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> also changes account information, such as
      password expiry dates and intervals.</p><p>For password changes, the user is first prompted for their old
      password, if one is present. This password is then encrypted and compared
      against the stored password. The user has only one chance to enter the
      correct password. The administrators are permitted to bypass this step so
      that forgotten passwords may be changed.</p><p>The user is then prompted for a replacement password.
      <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> will prompt twice for this replacement and
      compare the second entry against the first. Both entries are required to
      match in order for the password to be changed.</p><p>After the password has been entered, password aging information is
      checked to see if the user is permitted to change their password at this
      time. If not, <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> refuses to change the password
      and exits.</p><p> To get current password status information, use the
      <code class="literal">-S</code> option. Administrators can use
      <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> to perform several account maintenance
      functions (users may perform some of these functions on their own
      accounts). Accounts may be locked with the <code class="literal">-l</code> flag and
      unlocked with the <code class="literal">-u</code> flag. Similarly,
      <code class="literal">-c</code> disables a user's ability to change passwords, and
      <code class="literal">-C</code> allows a user to change passwords. For password
      expiry, the <code class="literal">-e</code> option disables expiration, while the
      <code class="literal">-E</code> option causes the password to expire according to
      the system's normal aging rules. Use <code class="literal">-p</code> to disable the
      password requirement for a user, or <code class="literal">-P</code> to require a
      password. </p><p>Administrators can also use <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> to change
      system-wide password expiry and length requirements with the
      <code class="literal">-i</code>, <code class="literal">-n</code>, <code class="literal">-x</code>, and
      <code class="literal">-L</code> options. The <code class="literal">-i</code> option is used
      to disable an account after the password has been expired for a number of
      days. After a user account has had an expired password for
      <span class="emphasis"><em>NUM</em></span> days, the user may no longer sign on to the
      account. The <code class="literal">-n</code> option is used to set the minimum
      number of days before a password may be changed. The user will not be
      permitted to change the password until <span class="emphasis"><em>MINDAYS</em></span> days
      have elapsed. The <code class="literal">-x</code> option is used to set the maximum
      number of days a password remains valid. After
      <span class="emphasis"><em>MAXDAYS</em></span> days, the password is required to be
      changed. Allowed values for the above options are 0 to 999. The
      <code class="literal">-L</code> option sets the minimum length of allowed passwords
      for users who don't belong to the administrators group to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>LEN</em></span> characters. Allowed values for the minimum
      password length are 0 to 14. In any of the above cases, a value of 0
      means `no restrictions'.</p><p> All operations affecting the current user are by default run against
      the logon server of the current user (taken from the environment variable
      <code class="envar">LOGONSERVER</code>. When password or account information of other
      users should be changed, the logon server is evaluated automatically.
      In rare cases, it might be necessary to switch to another domain
      controller to perform the action.  In this case, use the
      <code class="literal">-d</code> option to specify the machine to run the command
      against. Note that the current user must have account operator permissions
      to perform user account changes in a domain. </p><p>Users can use the <span class="command"><strong>passwd -R</strong></span> to enter a password
      which then gets stored in a special area of the registry on the local
      system, which is also used by Windows to store passwords of accounts
      running Windows services. When a privileged Cygwin application calls the
      <span class="command"><strong>set{e}uid(user_id)</strong></span> system call, Cygwin checks if a
      password for that user has been stored in this registry area. If so, it
      uses this password to switch to this user account using that password.
      This allows you to logon through, for instance, <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>
      with public key authentication and get a full qualified user token with
      all credentials for network access. However, the method has some
      drawbacks security-wise. This is explained in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ntsec.html" title="POSIX accounts, permission, and security">the section called &#8220;POSIX accounts, permission, and security&#8221;</a>.</p><p>Please note that storing passwords in that registry area is a
      privileged operation which only administrative accounts are allowed to
      do. Administrators can enter the password for other user accounts into
      the registry by specifying the username on the commandline. If normal,
      non-admin users should be allowed to enter their passwords using
      <span class="command"><strong>passwd -R</strong></span>, it's required to run
      <span class="command"><strong>cygserver</strong></span> as a service under the LocalSystem account
      before running <span class="command"><strong>passwd -R</strong></span>. This only affects storing
      passwords. Using passwords in privileged processes does not require
      <span class="command"><strong>cygserver</strong></span> to run.</p><p>Limitations: Users may not be able to change their password on some
      systems.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="newgrp.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="using-utils.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="pldd.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">newgrp&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="cygwin-ug-net.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&#160;pldd</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
