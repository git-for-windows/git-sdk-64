=head1 NAME

perlintern - autogenerated documentation of purely B<internal>
Perl functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<internal Perl functions> X<interpreter functions>

This file is the autogenerated documentation of functions in the
Perl interpreter that are documented using Perl's internal documentation
format but are not marked as part of the Perl API.  In other words,
B<they are not for use in extensions>!

It has the same sections as L<perlapi>, though some may be empty.



=head1 AV Handling

=over 4

=item C<av_fetch_simple>
X<av_fetch_simple>

This is a cut-down version of av_fetch that assumes that the array is
very straightforward - no magic, not readonly, and AvREAL - and that
C<key> is not negative. This function MUST NOT be used in situations
where any of those assumptions may not hold.

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If lval is true, you are guaranteed to get a real SV back (in case
it wasn't real before), which you can then modify.  Check that the return
value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

The rough perl equivalent is C<$myarray[$key]>.

=item C<AvFILLp>
X<AvFILLp>

If the array C<av> is empty, this returns -1; otherwise it returns the maximum
value of the indices of all the array elements which are currently defined in
C<av>.  It does not handle magic, hence the C<p> private indication in its name.

=item C<av_new_alloc>
X<av_new_alloc>

This implements L<perlapi/C<newAV_alloc_x>>
and L<perlapi/C<newAV_alloc_xz>>, which are the public API for this
functionality.

Creates a new AV and allocates its SV* array.

This is similar to, but more efficient than doing:

    AV *av = newAV();
    av_extend(av, key);

The size parameter is used to pre-allocate a SV* array large enough to
hold at least elements C<0..(size-1)>.  C<size> must be at least 1.

The C<zeroflag> parameter controls whether or not the array is NULL
initialized.

X<av_store_simple>

This is a cut-down version of av_store that assumes that the array is
very straightforward - no magic, not readonly, and AvREAL - and that
C<key> is not negative. This function MUST NOT be used in situations
where any of those assumptions may not hold.

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>. It
can be dereferenced to get the C<SV*> that was stored there (= C<val>)).

Note that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C<splice(@myarray, $key, 1, $val)>.

Be aware that there is a signficant difference in timing between the

=item C<save_scalar_at>
X<save_scalar_at>

A helper function for localizing the SV referenced by C<*sptr>.

If C<SAVEf_KEEPOLDELEM> is set in in C<flags>, the function returns the input
scalar untouched.

Otherwise it replaces C<*sptr> with a new C<undef> scalar, and returns that.
The new scalar will have the old one's magic (if any) copied to it.
If there is such magic, and C<SAVEf_SETMAGIC> is set in in C<flags>, 'set'
magic will be processed on the new scalar.  If unset, 'set' magic will be
skipped.  The latter typically means that assignment will soon follow (I<e.g.>,
S<C<'local $x = $y'>>), and that will handle the magic.

=item C<CvWEAKOUTSIDE>
X<CvWEAKOUTSIDE>

Each CV has a pointer, C<CvOUTSIDE()>, to its lexically enclosing
CV (if any).  Because pointers to anonymous sub prototypes are
stored in C<&> pad slots, it is a possible to get a circular reference,
with the parent pointing to the child and vice-versa.  To avoid the
ensuing memory leak, we do not increment the reference count of the CV
pointed to by C<CvOUTSIDE> in the I<one specific instance> that the parent
has a C<&> pad slot pointing back to us.  In this case, we set the
C<CvWEAKOUTSIDE> flag in the child.  This allows us to determine under what
circumstances we should decrement the refcount of the parent when freeing
the child.

There is a further complication with non-closure anonymous subs (i.e. those
that do not refer to any lexicals outside that sub).  In this case, the
anonymous prototype is shared rather than being cloned.  This has the
consequence that the parent may be freed while there are still active
children, I<e.g.>,

    BEGIN { $a = sub { eval '$x' } }

In this case, the BEGIN is freed immediately after execution since there
are no active references to it: the anon sub prototype has
C<CvWEAKOUTSIDE> set since it's not a closure, and $a points to the same
CV, so it doesn't contribute to BEGIN's refcount either.  When $a is
executed, the C<eval '$x'> causes the chain of C<CvOUTSIDE>s to be followed,
and the freed BEGIN is accessed.

To avoid this, whenever a CV and its associated pad is freed, any
C<&> entries in the pad are explicitly removed from the pad, and if the
refcount of the pointed-to anon sub is still positive, then that
child's C<CvOUTSIDE> is set to point to its grandparent.  This will only
occur in the single specific case of a non-closure anon prototype
having one or more active references (such as C<$a> above).

One other thing to consider is that a CV may be merely undefined
rather than freed, eg C<undef &foo>.  In this case, its refcount may
not have reached zero, but we still delete its pad and its C<CvROOT> etc.
Since various children may still have their C<CvOUTSIDE> pointing at this
undefined CV, we keep its own C<CvOUTSIDE> for the time being, so that
the chain of lexical scopes is unbroken.  For example, the following
should print 123:

    my $x = 123;
    sub tmp { sub { eval '$x' } }
    my $a = tmp();
    undef &tmp;
    print  $a->();

=item C<docatch>
X<docatch>

Interpose, for the current op and RUNOPS loop,

    - a new JMPENV stack catch frame, and
    - an inner RUNOPS loop to run all the remaining ops following the
      current PL_op.

Then handle any exceptions raised while in that loop.
For a caught eval at this level, re-enter the loop with the specified
restart op (i.e. the op following the OP_LEAVETRY etc); otherwise re-throw
the exception.

docatch() is intended to be used like this:

    PP(pp_entertry)
    {
        if (CATCH_GET)
            return docatch(Perl_pp_entertry);

        ... rest of function ...
        return PL_op->op_next;
    }

If a new catch frame isn't needed, the op behaves normally. Otherwise it
calls docatch(), which recursively calls pp_entertry(), this time with
CATCH_GET() false, so the rest of the body of the entertry is run. Then
docatch() calls CALLRUNOPS() which executes all the ops following the
entertry. When the loop finally finishes, control returns to docatch(),
which pops the JMPENV and returns to the parent pp_entertry(), which
itself immediately returns. Note that *all* subsequent ops are run within
the inner RUNOPS loop, not just the body of the eval. For example, in

    sub TIEARRAY { eval {1}; my $x }
    tie @a, "main";

at the point the 'my' is executed, the C stack will look something like:

    #10 main()
    #9  perl_run()              # JMPENV_PUSH level 1 here
    #8  S_run_body()
    #7  Perl_runops_standard()  # main RUNOPS loop
    #6  Perl_pp_tie()
    #5  Perl_call_sv()
    #4  Perl_runops_standard()  # unguarded RUNOPS loop: no new JMPENV
    #3  Perl_pp_entertry()
    #2  S_docatch()             # JMPENV_PUSH level 2 here
    #1  Perl_runops_standard()  # docatch()'s RUNOPs loop
    #0  Perl_pp_padsv()

Basically, any section of the perl core which starts a RUNOPS loop may
make a promise that it will catch any exceptions and restart the loop if
necessary. If it's not prepared to do that (like call_sv() isn't), then
it sets CATCH_GET() to true, so that any later eval-like code knows to
set up a new handler and loop (via docatch()).

See L<perlinterp/"Exception handing"> for further details.

X<pad_findlex>

Find a named lexical anywhere in a chain of nested pads.  Add fake entries

Returns the offset in the bottom pad of the lex or the fake lex.
C<cv> is the CV in which to start the search, and seq is the current C<cop_seq>
to match against.  If C<warn> is true, print appropriate warnings.  The C<out_>*
vars return values, and so are pointers to where the returned values
should be stored.  C<out_capture>, if non-null, requests that the innermost
instance of the lexical is captured; C<out_name> is set to the innermost
matched pad name or fake pad name; C<out_flags> returns the flags normally
associated with the C<PARENT_FAKELEX_FLAGS> field of a fake pad name.

Note that C<pad_findlex()> is recursive; it recurses up the chain of CVs,
then comes back down, adding fake entries
as it goes.  It has to be this way
because fake names in anon prototypes have to store in C<xpadn_low> the
index into the parent pad.

=item C<amagic_applies>
X<amagic_applies>

Check C<sv> to see if the overloaded (active magic) operation C<method>
applies to it. If the sv is not SvROK or it is not an object then returns
false, otherwise checks if the object is blessed into a class supporting
overloaded operations, and returns true if a call to amagic_call() with
this SV and the given method would trigger an amagic operation, including
via the overload fallback rules or via nomethod. Thus a call like:

    amagic_applies(sv, string_amg, AMG_unary)

would return true for an object with overloading set up in any of the
following ways:

    use overload q("") => sub { ... };
    use overload q(0+) => sub { ... }, fallback => 1;

and could be used to tell if a given object would stringify to something
other than the normal default ref stringification.

Note that the fact that this function returns TRUE does not mean you
can succesfully perform the operation with amagic_call(), for instance
any overloaded method might throw a fatal exception,  however if this
function returns FALSE you can be confident that it will NOT perform
the given overload operation.

C<method> is an integer enum, one of the values found in F<overload.h>,
for instance C<string_amg>.

C<flags> should be set to AMG_unary for unary operations.

If the typeglob C<gv> can be expressed more succinctly, by having
something other than a real GV in its place in the stash, replace it
with the optimised form.  Basic requirements for this are that C<gv>
is a real typeglob, is sufficiently ordinary, and is only referenced
from its package.  This function is meant to be used when a GV has been
looked up in part to see what was there, causing upgrading, but based
on what was found it turns out that the real GV isn't required after all.

If C<gv> is a completely empty typeglob, it is deleted from the stash.

If C<gv> is a typeglob containing only a sufficiently-ordinary constant
sub, the typeglob is replaced with a scalar-reference placeholder that
more compactly represents the same thing.

=item C<refcounted_he_new_pvn>
X<refcounted_he_new_pvn>

Creates a new C<refcounted_he>.  This consists of a single key/value
pair and a reference to an existing C<refcounted_he> chain (which may
be empty), and thus forms a longer chain.  When using the longer chain,
the new key/value pair takes precedence over any entry for the same key
further along the chain.

The new key is specified by C<keypv> and C<keylen>.  If C<flags> has
the C<REFCOUNTED_HE_KEY_UTF8> bit set, the key octets are interpreted
as UTF-8, otherwise they are interpreted as Latin-1.  C<hash> is
a precomputed hash of the key string, or zero if it has not been
precomputed.

C<value> is the scalar value to store for this key.  C<value> is copied
by this function, which thus does not take ownership of any reference
to it, and later changes to the scalar will not be reflected in the
value visible in the C<refcounted_he>.  Complex types of scalar will not
be stored with referential integrity, but will be coerced to strings.
C<value> may be either null or C<&PL_sv_placeholder> to indicate that no
value is to be associated with the key; this, as with any non-null value,
takes precedence over the existence of a value for the key further along
the chain.

C<parent> points to the rest of the C<refcounted_he> chain to be
attached to the new C<refcounted_he>.  This function takes ownership
of one reference to C<parent>, and returns one reference to the new
C<refcounted_he>.

=item C<newATTRSUB_x>
X<newATTRSUB_x>

Construct a Perl subroutine, also performing some surrounding jobs.

This function is expected to be called in a Perl compilation context,
and some aspects of the subroutine are taken from global variables
associated with compilation.  In particular, C<PL_compcv> represents
the subroutine that is currently being compiled.  It must be non-null
when this function is called, and some aspects of the subroutine being
constructed are taken from it.  The constructed subroutine may actually
be a reuse of the C<PL_compcv> object, but will not necessarily be so.

If C<block> is null then the subroutine will have no body, and for the
time being it will be an error to call it.  This represents a forward
subroutine declaration such as S<C<sub foo ($$);>>.  If C<block> is
non-null then it provides the Perl code of the subroutine body, which
will be executed when the subroutine is called.  This body includes
any argument unwrapping code resulting from a subroutine signature or
similar.  The pad use of the code must correspond to the pad attached
to C<PL_compcv>.  The code is not expected to include a C<leavesub> or
C<leavesublv> op; this function will add such an op.  C<block> is consumed
by this function and will become part of the constructed subroutine.

C<proto> specifies the subroutine's prototype, unless one is supplied
as an attribute (see below).  If C<proto> is null, then the subroutine
will not have a prototype.  If C<proto> is non-null, it must point to a
C<const> op whose value is a string, and the subroutine will have that
string as its prototype.  If a prototype is supplied as an attribute, the
attribute takes precedence over C<proto>, but in that case C<proto> should
preferably be null.  In any case, C<proto> is consumed by this function.

C<attrs> supplies attributes to be applied the subroutine.  A handful of
attributes take effect by built-in means, being applied to C<PL_compcv>
immediately when seen.  Other attributes are collected up and attached
to the subroutine by this route.  C<attrs> may be null to supply no
attributes, or point to a C<const> op for a single attribute, or point
to a C<list> op whose children apart from the C<pushmark> are C<const>
ops for one or more attributes.  Each C<const> op must be a string,
giving the attribute name optionally followed by parenthesised arguments,
in the manner in which attributes appear in Perl source.  The attributes
will be applied to the sub by this function.  C<attrs> is consumed by
this function.

If C<o_is_gv> is false and C<o> is null, then the subroutine will
be anonymous.  If C<o_is_gv> is false and C<o> is non-null, then C<o>
must point to a C<const> OP, which will be consumed by this function,
and its string value supplies a name for the subroutine.  The name may
be qualified or unqualified, and if it is unqualified then a default
stash will be selected in some manner.  If C<o_is_gv> is true, then C<o>
doesn't point to an C<OP> at all, but is instead a cast pointer to a C<GV>
by which the subroutine will be named.

If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then the new
sub will either replace the existing one in the glob or be merged with
the existing one.  A warning may be generated about redefinition.

If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as C<BEGIN> or
C<END>, then it will be claimed by the appropriate queue for automatic
running of phase-related subroutines.  In this case the relevant glob will
be left not containing any subroutine, even if it did contain one before.
In the case of C<BEGIN>, the subroutine will be executed and the reference
to it disposed of before this function returns.

The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.  If the sub
is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the subroutine
is transferred to the caller.  If the sub is named then the caller does
not get ownership of a reference.  In most such cases, where the sub
has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is returned
by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it.  A phase-named
subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference owned by the
phase's automatic run queue.  But a C<BEGIN> subroutine, having already
been executed, will quite likely have been destroyed already by the
time this function returns, making it erroneous for the caller to make
any use of the returned pointer.  It is the caller's responsibility to
ensure that it knows which of these situations applies.

=item C<newXS_len_flags>
X<newXS_len_flags>

Construct an XS subroutine, also performing some surrounding jobs.

The subroutine will have the entry point C<subaddr>.  It will have
the prototype specified by the nul-terminated string C<proto>, or
no prototype if C<proto> is null.  The prototype string is copied;
the caller can mutate the supplied string afterwards.  If C<filename>
is non-null, it must be a nul-terminated filename, and the subroutine
will have its C<CvFILE> set accordingly.  By default C<CvFILE> is set to
point directly to the supplied string, which must be static.  If C<flags>
has the C<XS_DYNAMIC_FILENAME> bit set, then a copy of the string will
be taken instead.

Other aspects of the subroutine will be left in their default state.
If anything else needs to be done to the subroutine for it to function
correctly, it is the caller's responsibility to do that after this
function has constructed it.  However, beware of the subroutine
potentially being destroyed before this function returns, as described
below.

If C<name> is null then the subroutine will be anonymous, with its
C<CvGV> referring to an C<__ANON__> glob.  If C<name> is non-null then the
subroutine will be named accordingly, referenced by the appropriate glob.
C<name> is a string of length C<len> bytes giving a sigilless symbol name,
in UTF-8 if C<flags> has the C<SVf_UTF8> bit set and in Latin-1 otherwise.
The name may be either qualified or unqualified, with the stash defaulting
in the same manner as for C<gv_fetchpvn_flags>.  C<flags> may contain
flag bits understood by C<gv_fetchpvn_flags> with the same meaning as
they have there, such as C<GV_ADDWARN>.  The symbol is always added to
the stash if necessary, with C<GV_ADDMULTI> semantics.

If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then the new sub
will replace the existing one in the glob.  A warning may be generated
about the redefinition.  If the old subroutine was C<CvCONST> then the
decision about whether to warn is influenced by an expectation about
whether the new subroutine will become a constant of similar value.
That expectation is determined by C<const_svp>.  (Note that the call to
this function doesn't make the new subroutine C<CvCONST> in any case;
that is left to the caller.)  If C<const_svp> is null then it indicates
that the new subroutine will not become a constant.  If C<const_svp>
is non-null then it indicates that the new subroutine will become a
constant, and it points to an C<SV*> that provides the constant value
that the subroutine will have.

If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as C<BEGIN> or
C<END>, then it will be claimed by the appropriate queue for automatic
running of phase-related subroutines.  In this case the relevant glob will
be left not containing any subroutine, even if it did contain one before.
In the case of C<BEGIN>, the subroutine will be executed and the reference
to it disposed of before this function returns, and also before its
prototype is set.  If a C<BEGIN> subroutine would not be sufficiently
constructed by this function to be ready for execution then the caller
must prevent this happening by giving the subroutine a different name.

The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.  If the sub
is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the subroutine
is transferred to the caller.  If the sub is named then the caller does
not get ownership of a reference.  In most such cases, where the sub
has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is returned
by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it.  A phase-named
subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference owned by the
phase's automatic run queue.  But a C<BEGIN> subroutine, having already
been executed, will quite likely have been destroyed already by the
time this function returns, making it erroneous for the caller to make
any use of the returned pointer.  It is the caller's responsibility to
ensure that it knows which of these situations applies.

=item C<delimcpy_no_escape>
X<delimcpy_no_escape>

Copy a source buffer to a destination buffer, stopping at (but not including)
the first occurrence in the source of the delimiter byte, C<delim>.  The source
is the bytes between S<C<from> and C<from_end> - 1>.  Similarly, the dest is
C<to> up to C<to_end>.

The number of bytes copied is written to C<*retlen>.

Returns the position of C<delim> in the C<from> buffer, but if there is no
such occurrence before C<from_end>, then C<from_end> is returned, and the entire
buffer S<C<from> .. C<from_end> - 1> is copied.

If there is room in the destination available after the copy, an extra
terminating safety C<NUL> byte is appended (not included in the returned
length).

The error case is if the destination buffer is not large enough to accommodate
everything that should be copied.  In this situation, a value larger than
S<C<to_end> - C<to>> is written to C<*retlen>, and as much of the source as
fits will be written to the destination.  Not having room for the safety C<NUL>
is not considered an error.

X<quadmath_format_needed>

C<quadmath_format_needed()> returns true if the C<format> string seems to
contain at least one non-Q-prefixed C<%[efgaEFGA]> format specifier,
or returns false otherwise.

The format specifier detection is not complete printf-syntax detection,
but it should catch most common cases.

If true is returned, those arguments B<should> in theory be processed
with C<quadmath_snprintf()>, but in case there is more than one such
format specifier (see L</quadmath_format_valid>), and if there is
anything else beyond that one (even just a single byte), they
B<cannot> be processed because C<quadmath_snprintf()> is very strict,
accepting only one format spec, and nothing else.
In this case, the code should probably fail.

one format spec.

C<quadmath_format_valid()> checks that the intended single spec looks
sane: begins with C<%>, has only one C<%>, ends with C<[efgaEFGA]>,
and has C<Q> before it.  This is not a full "printf syntax check",
just the basics.

Returns true if it is valid, false if not.

A quick flag check to see whether an C<sv> should be passed to C<sv_force_normal>

For example, if your scalar is a reference and you want to modify the C<SvIVX>

This is used internally by various sv-modifying functions, such as

=item C<bytes_from_utf8_loc>
X<bytes_from_utf8_loc>

NOTE: C<bytes_from_utf8_loc> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Like C<L<perlapi/bytes_from_utf8>()>, but takes an extra parameter, a pointer
to where to store the location of the first character in C<"s"> that cannot be
converted to non-UTF8.

If that parameter is C<NULL>, this function behaves identically to
C<bytes_from_utf8>.

Otherwise if C<*is_utf8p> is 0 on input, the function behaves identically to
C<bytes_from_utf8>, except it also sets C<*first_non_downgradable> to C<NULL>.

Otherwise, the function returns a newly created C<NUL>-terminated string
containing the non-UTF8 equivalent of the convertible first portion of
C<"s">.  C<*lenp> is set to its length, not including the terminating C<NUL>.
If the entire input string was converted, C<*is_utf8p> is set to a FALSE value,
and C<*first_non_downgradable> is set to C<NULL>.

Otherwise, C<*first_non_downgradable> is set to point to the first byte of the
first character in the original string that wasn't converted.  C<*is_utf8p> is
unchanged.  Note that the new string may have length 0.

Another way to look at it is, if C<*first_non_downgradable> is non-C<NULL> and
C<*is_utf8p> is TRUE, this function starts at the beginning of C<"s"> and
converts as many characters in it as possible stopping at the first one it
finds that can't be converted to non-UTF-8.  C<*first_non_downgradable> is
set to point to that.  The function returns the portion that could be converted
in a newly created C<NUL>-terminated string, and C<*lenp> is set to its length,
not including the terminating C<NUL>.  If the very first character in the
original could not be converted, C<*lenp> will be 0, and the new string will
contain just a single C<NUL>.  If the entire input string was converted,
C<*is_utf8p> is set to FALSE and C<*first_non_downgradable> is set to C<NULL>.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the converted portion of the
string can be computed by having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call,
and subtracting the after-call value of C<*lenp> from it.

X<find_uninit_var>

NOTE: C<find_uninit_var> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Find the name of the undefined variable (if any) that caused the operator
to issue a "Use of uninitialized value" warning.
If match is true, only return a name if its value matches C<uninit_sv>.
So roughly speaking, if a unary operator (such as C<OP_COS>) generates a
warning, then following the direct child of the op may yield an
C<OP_PADSV> or C<OP_GV> that gives the name of the undefined variable.  On the
other hand, with C<OP_ADD> there are two branches to follow, so we only print
the variable name if we get an exact match.
C<desc_p> points to a string pointer holding the description of the op.
This may be updated if needed.

The name is returned as a mortal SV.

Assumes that C<PL_op> is the OP that originally triggered the error, and that
C<PL_comppad>/C<PL_curpad> points to the currently executing pad.

=item C<isSCRIPT_RUN>
X<isSCRIPT_RUN>

Returns a bool as to whether or not the sequence of bytes from C<s> up to but
not including C<send> form a "script run".  C<utf8_target> is TRUE iff the
sequence starting at C<s> is to be treated as UTF-8.  To be precise, except for
two degenerate cases given below, this function returns TRUE iff all code
points in it come from any combination of three "scripts" given by the Unicode
"Script Extensions" property: Common, Inherited, and possibly one other.
Additionally all decimal digits must come from the same consecutive sequence of
10.

For example, if all the characters in the sequence are Greek, or Common, or
Inherited, this function will return TRUE, provided any decimal digits in it
are from the same block of digits in Common.  (These are the ASCII digits
"0".."9" and additionally a block for full width forms of these, and several
others used in mathematical notation.)   For scripts (unlike Greek) that have
their own digits defined this will accept either digits from that set or from
one of the Common digit sets, but not a combination of the two.  Some scripts,
such as Arabic, have more than one set of digits.  All digits must come from
the same set for this function to return TRUE.

C<*ret_script>, if C<ret_script> is not NULL, will on return of TRUE
contain the script found, using the C<SCX_enum> typedef.  Its value will be
C<SCX_INVALID> if the function returns FALSE.

If the sequence is empty, TRUE is returned, but C<*ret_script> (if asked for)
will be C<SCX_INVALID>.

If the sequence contains a single code point which is unassigned to a character
in the version of Unicode being used, the function will return TRUE, and the
script will be C<SCX_Unknown>.  Any other combination of unassigned code points
in the input sequence will result in the function treating the input as not
being a script run.

The returned script will be C<SCX_Inherited> iff all the code points in it are
from the Inherited script.

Otherwise, the returned script will be C<SCX_Common> iff all the code points in
it are from the Inherited or Common scripts.

C<B<DEPRECATED!>>  It is planned to remove C<utf8n_to_uvuni>
from a future release of Perl.  Do not use it for
new code; remove it from existing code.

Instead use L<perlapi/utf8_to_uvchr_buf>, or rarely, L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr>.

This function was useful for code that wanted to handle both EBCDIC and
ASCII platforms with Unicode properties, but starting in Perl v5.20, the
distinctions between the platforms have mostly been made invisible to most
code, so this function is quite unlikely to be what you want.  If you do need
this precise functionality, use instead
C<L<NATIVE_TO_UNI(utf8_to_uvchr_buf(...))|perlapi/utf8_to_uvchr_buf>>

C<B<DEPRECATED!>>  It is planned to remove C<utf8_to_uvuni>
from a future release of Perl.  Do not use it for
new code; remove it from existing code.

Returns the Unicode code point of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding; C<retlen> will be set to the
length, in bytes, of that character.

Some, but not all, UTF-8 malformations are detected, and in fact, some
malformed input could cause reading beyond the end of the input buffer, which
is one reason why this function is deprecated.  The other is that only in
extremely limited circumstances should the Unicode versus native code point be
of any interest to you.

If C<s> points to one of the detected malformations, and UTF8 warnings are
enabled, zero is returned and C<*retlen> is set (if C<retlen> doesn't point to
NULL) to -1.  If those warnings are off, the computed value if well-defined (or
the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C<*retlen>
is set (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>) is the
next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.
See L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr> for details on when the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned.

X<variant_under_utf8_count>

This function looks at the sequence of bytes between C<s> and C<e>, which are
assumed to be encoded in ASCII/Latin1, and returns how many of them would
change should the string be translated into UTF-8.  Due to the nature of UTF-8,
each of these would occupy two bytes instead of the single one in the input
string.  Thus, this function returns the precise number of bytes the string
would expand by when translated to UTF-8.

Unlike most of the other functions that have C<utf8> in their name, the input
to this function is NOT a UTF-8-encoded string.  The function name is slightly
I<odd> to emphasize this.

This function is internal to Perl because khw thinks that any XS code that
would want this is probably operating too close to the internals.  Presenting a
valid use case could change that.
