;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This pass converts a CPS term in such a way that no function has any
;;; free variables.  Instead, closures are built explicitly as heap
;;; objects, and free variables are referenced through the closure.
;;;
;;; Closure conversion also removes any $rec expressions that
;;; contification did not handle.  See (language cps) for a further
;;; discussion of $rec.
;;;
;;; Before closure conversion, function self variables are always bound.
;;; After closure conversion, well-known functions with no free
;;; variables may have no self reference.
