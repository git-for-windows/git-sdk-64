;;; {Line Buffering Input Ports}
;;;
;;; [This is a work-around to get past certain deficiencies in the capabilities
;;;  of ports.  Eventually, ports should be fixed and this module nuked.]
;;;
;;; A line buffering input port supports:
;;;
;;; 	read-string  	which returns the next line of input
;;;	unread-string 	which pushes a line back onto the stream
;;; 
;;; The implementation of unread-string is kind of limited; it doesn't
;;; interact properly with unread-char, or any of the other port
;;; reading functions.  Only read-string will get you back the things that
;;; unread-string accepts.
;;;
;;; Normally a "line" is all characters up to and including a newline.
;;; If lines are put back using unread-string, they can be broken arbitrarily
;;; -- that is, read-string returns strings passed to unread-string (or 
;;; shared substrings of them).
;;;

;; read-string port
;; unread-string port str
;;   Read (or buffer) a line from PORT.
;;
;; Not all ports support these functions -- only those with 
;; 'unread-string and 'read-string properties, bound to hooks
;; implementing these functions.
;;
