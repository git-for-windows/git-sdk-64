;;; ~ Implementation notes ~
;;;
;;; Statprof can be divided into two pieces: data collection and data
;;; analysis.
;;;
;;; The data collection runs concurrently with the program, and is
;;; designed to be as cheap as possible.  The main data collection
;;; instrument is the stack sampler, driven by SIGPROF signals that are
;;; scheduled with periodic setitimer calls.  The stack sampler simply
;;; looks at every frame on the stack, and writes a representation of
;;; the frame's procedure into a growable buffer.
;;;
;;; For most frames, this representation is the instruction pointer of
;;; that frame, because it's cheap to get and you can map from
;;; instruction pointer to procedure fairly cheaply.  This won't
;;; distinguish between different closures which share the same code,
;;; but that is usually what we want anyway.
;;;
;;; The other part of data collection is the exact call counter, which
;;; uses the VM's "apply" hook to record each procedure call.
;;; Naturally, this is quite expensive, and it is off by default.
;;; Running code at every procedure call effectively penalizes procedure
;;; calls.  Still, it's useful sometimes.  If the profiler state has a
;;; call-counts table, then calls will be counted.  As with the stack
;;; counter, the key in the hash table is the code pointer of the
;;; procedure being called.  The call counter can also see calls of
;;; non-programs, for example in the case of applicable structs.  In
;;; that case the key is the procedure itself.
;;;
;;; After collection is finished, the data can be analyzed.  The first
;;; step is usually to run over the stack traces, tabulating sample
;;; counts by procedure; the stack-samples->procedure-data does that.
;;; The result of stack-samples->procedure-data is a hash table mapping
;;; procedures to "call data" records.  The call data values are exposed
;;; to users via the statprof-fold-call-data procedure.
;;;
;;; Usually all the analysis is triggered by calling statprof-display,
;;; or having the statprof procedure call it for you.
;;;
;;; The other thing we can do is to look at the stacks themselves, for
;;; example via statprof-fetch-call-tree.
;;;

;;; ~ Threads and state ~
;;;
;;; The state of the profiler is contained in a <state> record, which is
;;; bound to a thread-local parameter.  The accurate call counter uses
;;; the VM apply hook, which is also local to the current thread, so all
;;; is good there.
;;;
;;; The problem comes in the statistical stack sampler's use of
;;; `setitimer' and SIGPROF.  The timer manipulated by setitimer is a
;;; whole-process timer, so it decrements as other threads execute,
;;; which is the wrong thing if you want to profile just one thread.  On
;;; the other hand, SIGPROF is delivered to the process as a whole,
;;; which is fine given Guile's signal-handling thread, but then only
;;; delivered to the thread running statprof, which isn't the right
;;; thing if you want to profile the whole system.
;;;
;;; The summary is that statprof works more or less well as a per-thread
;;; profiler if no other threads are running on their own when
;;; profiling.  If the other threads are running on behalf of the thread
;;; being profiled (as via futures or parallel marking) things still
;;; mostly work as expected.  You can run statprof in one thread,
;;; finish, and then run statprof in another thread, and the profile
;;; runs won't affect each other.  But if you want true per-thread
;;; profiles when other things are happening in the process, including
;;; other statprof runs, or whole-process profiles with per-thread
;;; breakdowns, the use of setitimer currently prevents that.
;;;
;;; The solution would be to switch to POSIX.1-2001's timer_create(2),
;;; and to add some more threading-related API to statprof.  Some other
;;; day.
