       https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html
       says
       "The XML in metainfo files does not need any XML namespace, and adding
       one should generally be avoided. If you want to use a namespace though
       (maybe in case you want to embed the data in other contexts), the xmlns
       should be https://specifications.freedesktop.org/metainfo/1.0."
