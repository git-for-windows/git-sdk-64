<h1 class="chapter"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC368">17. Concluding Remarks</a> </h1>

<p>We would like to conclude this GNU <code>gettext</code> manual by presenting
an history of the Translation Project so far.  We finally give
a few pointers for those who want to do further research or readings
about Native Language Support matters.
</p>


<a name="History"></a>
<a name="SEC376"></a>
<h2 class="section"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC369">17.1 History of GNU <code>gettext</code></a> </h2>

<p>Internationalization concerns and algorithms have been informally
and casually discussed for years in GNU, sometimes around GNU
<code>libc</code>, maybe around the incoming <code>Hurd</code>, or otherwise
(nobody clearly remembers).  And even then, when the work started for
real, this was somewhat independently of these previous discussions.
</p>
<p>This all began in July 1994, when Patrick D'Cruze had the idea and
initiative of internationalizing version 3.9.2 of GNU <code>fileutils</code>.
He then asked Jim Meyering, the maintainer, how to get those changes
folded into an official release.  That first draft was full of
<code>#ifdef</code>s and somewhat disconcerting, and Jim wanted to find
nicer ways.  Patrick and Jim shared some tries and experimentations
in this area.  Then, feeling that this might eventually have a deeper
impact on GNU, Jim wanted to know what standards were, and contacted
Richard Stallman, who very quickly and verbally described an overall
design for what was meant to become <code>glocale</code>, at that time.
</p>
<p>Jim implemented <code>glocale</code> and got a lot of exhausting feedback
from Patrick and Richard, of course, but also from Mitchum DSouza
(who wrote a <code>catgets</code>-like package), Roland McGrath, maybe David
MacKenzie, Fran&ccedil;ois Pinard, and Paul Eggert, all pushing and
pulling in various directions, not always compatible, to the extent
that after a couple of test releases, <code>glocale</code> was torn apart.
In particular, Paul Eggert &ndash; always keeping an eye on developments
in Solaris &ndash; advocated the use of the <code>gettext</code> API over
<code>glocale</code>'s <code>catgets</code>-based API.
</p>
<p>While Jim took some distance and time and became dad for a second
time, Roland wanted to get GNU <code>libc</code> internationalized, and
got Ulrich Drepper involved in that project.  Instead of starting
from <code>glocale</code>, Ulrich rewrote something from scratch, but
more conforming to the set of guidelines who emerged out of the
<code>glocale</code> effort.  Then, Ulrich got people from the previous
forum to involve themselves into this new project, and the switch
from <code>glocale</code> to what was first named <code>msgutils</code>, renamed
<code>nlsutils</code>, and later <code>gettext</code>, became officially accepted
by Richard in May 1995 or so.
</p>
<p>Let's summarize by saying that Ulrich Drepper wrote GNU <code>gettext</code>
in April 1995.  The first official release of the package, including
PO mode, occurred in July 1995, and was numbered 0.7.  Other people
contributed to the effort by providing a discussion forum around
Ulrich, writing little pieces of code, or testing.  These are quoted
in the <code>THANKS</code> file which comes with the GNU <code>gettext</code>
distribution.
</p>
<p>While this was being done, Fran&ccedil;ois adapted half a dozen of
GNU packages to <code>glocale</code> first, then later to <code>gettext</code>,
putting them in pretest, so providing along the way an effective
user environment for fine tuning the evolving tools.  He also took
the responsibility of organizing and coordinating the Translation
Project.  After nearly a year of informal exchanges between people from
many countries, translator teams started to exist in May 1995, through
the creation and support by Patrick D'Cruze of twenty unmoderated
mailing lists for that many native languages, and two moderated
lists: one for reaching all teams at once, the other for reaching
all willing maintainers of internationalized free software packages.
</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois also wrote PO mode in June 1995 with the collaboration
of Greg McGary, as a kind of contribution to Ulrich's package.
He also gave a hand with the GNU <code>gettext</code> Texinfo manual.
</p>
<p>In 1997, Ulrich Drepper released the GNU libc 2.0, which included the
<code>gettext</code>, <code>textdomain</code> and <code>bindtextdomain</code> functions.
</p>
<p>In 2000, Ulrich Drepper added plural form handling (the <code>ngettext</code>
function) to GNU libc.  Later, in 2001, he released GNU libc 2.2.x,
which is the first free C library with full internationalization support.
</p>
<p>Ulrich being quite busy in his role of General Maintainer of GNU libc,
he handed over the GNU <code>gettext</code> maintenance to Bruno Haible in
2000.  Bruno added the plural form handling to the tools as well, added
support for UTF-8 and CJK locales, and wrote a few new tools for
manipulating PO files.

<h2 class="section"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC370">17.2 Notes on the Free Translation Project</a> </h2>

<p>This section contains the text that was, for a long time, distributed
as a file named <code>ABOUT-NLS</code>.
</p>
<p><strong> NOTE: </strong> This documentation section is outdated.  It it included
here for historical purposes only.
</p>

<p>Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project is
a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
together, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many
languages.  A few packages already provide translations for their messages.
</p>
<p>If you found this &lsquo;<tt>ABOUT-NLS</tt>&rsquo; file inside a distribution, you
may assume that the distributed package does use GNU <code>gettext</code>
internally, itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you
do <em>not</em> need to install GNU <code>gettext</code> prior to configuring,
installing or using this package with messages translated.
</p>
<p>Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also explain
how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the available
translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and work
on translations can contact the appropriate team.
</p>



<a name="INSTALL-Matters"></a>
<a name="SEC378"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC371">17.2.1 INSTALL Matters</a> </h3>

<p>Some packages are <em>localizable</em> when properly installed; the
programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
Most such packages use GNU <code>gettext</code>.  Other packages have their
own ways to internationalization, predating GNU <code>gettext</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
provides the GNU <code>gettext</code> functions.  Installers may use special
options at configuration time for changing the default behaviour.  The
command:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">./configure --disable-nls
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>will <em>totally</em> disable translation of messages.
</p>
<p>When you already have GNU <code>gettext</code> installed on your system and
run configure without an option for your new package, <code>configure</code>
will probably detect the previously built and installed &lsquo;<tt>libintl</tt>&rsquo;
library and will decide to use it.  If not, you may have to to use the
&lsquo;<samp>--with-libintl-prefix</samp>&rsquo; option to tell <code>configure</code> where to
look for it.
</p>
<p>Internationalized packages usually have many &lsquo;<tt>po/<var>ll</var>.po</tt>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<tt>po/<var>ll</var>_<var>CC</var>.po</tt>&rsquo;
files, where
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<var>ll</var> gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.
For some languages,
a two-letter code does not exist, and a three-letter code is used instead.
</li><li>
The optional <var>CC</var> is an ISO 3166 two-letter code of a country or
territory.
</li></ul>

<p>Unless translations have been forbidden
at <code>configure</code> time by using the &lsquo;<samp>--disable-nls</samp>&rsquo; switch,
all available translations are installed together with the package.
However, the environment variable <code>LINGUAS</code> may be set, prior
to configuration, to limit the installed set.
<code>LINGUAS</code> should then contain a space separated list of locale names
(of the form <code><var>ll</var></code> or <code><var>ll</var>_<var>CC</var></code>,
stating which languages or language variants are allowed.
</p>

<a name="Using-This-Package"></a>
<a name="SEC379"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC372">17.2.2 Using This Package</a> </h3>

<p>As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
only have to set the <code>LANG</code> environment variable to the appropriate
&lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var>_<var>CC</var></samp>&rsquo; combination.  If you happen to have the <code>LC_ALL</code>
or some other <code>LC_xxx</code> environment variables set, you should unset them
before setting <code>LANG</code>, otherwise the setting of <code>LANG</code> will not
have the desired effect.  Here
</p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>
&lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var></samp>&rsquo; is an ISO 639 two-letter language code.
For some languages,
a two-letter code does not exist, and a three-letter code is used instead.
</li><li>
&lsquo;<samp><var>CC</var></samp>&rsquo; is an ISO 3166 two-letter code of a country or territory.
</li></ul>

<p>For example, let's suppose that you
speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell prompt, merely execute
&lsquo;<samp>setenv LANG de_DE</samp>&rsquo; (in <code>csh</code>),
&lsquo;<samp>export LANG; LANG=de_DE</samp>&rsquo; (in <code>sh</code>) or
&lsquo;<samp>export LANG=de_DE</samp>&rsquo; (in <code>bash</code>).  This can be done from your
&lsquo;<tt>.login</tt>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<tt>.profile</tt>&rsquo; file, once and for all.
</p>
<p>You might think that the country code specification is redundant.  But in
fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp>de_AT</samp>&rsquo; is used for Austria, and &lsquo;<samp>pt_BR</samp>&rsquo; for Brazil.  The country
code serves to distinguish the dialects.
</p>
<p>The locale naming convention of &lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var>_<var>CC</var></samp>&rsquo;, with
&lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var></samp>&rsquo; denoting the language and &lsquo;<samp><var>CC</var></samp>&rsquo; denoting the
country, is the one use on systems based on GNU libc.  On other systems,
some variations of this scheme are used, such as &lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var>_<var>CC</var>.<var>encoding</var></samp>&rsquo;.  You can get the list of
locales supported by your system for your language by running the command
&lsquo;<samp>locale -a | grep '^<var>ll</var>'</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
This is done through a different environment variable, called
<code>LANGUAGE</code>.  GNU <code>gettext</code> gives preference to <code>LANGUAGE</code>
over <code>LANG</code> for the purpose of message handling, but you still
need to have <code>LANG</code> set to the primary language; this is required
by other parts of the system libraries.
For example, some Swedish users who would rather read translations in
German than English for when Swedish is not available, set <code>LANGUAGE</code>
to &lsquo;<samp>sv:de</samp>&rsquo; while leaving <code>LANG</code> to &lsquo;<samp>sv_SE</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
bokm&aring;l changed from &lsquo;<samp>no</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>nb</samp>&rsquo; recently (in 2003).
During the transition period, while some message catalogs for this language
are installed under &lsquo;<samp>nb</samp>&rsquo; and some older ones under &lsquo;<samp>no</samp>&rsquo;, it's
recommended for Norwegian users to set <code>LANGUAGE</code> to &lsquo;<samp>nb:no</samp>&rsquo; so that
both newer and older translations are used.
</p>
<p>In the <code>LANGUAGE</code> environment variable, but not in the <code>LANG</code>
environment variable, &lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var>_<var>CC</var></samp>&rsquo; combinations can be
abbreviated as &lsquo;<samp><var>ll</var></samp>&rsquo; to denote the language's main dialect.
For example, &lsquo;<samp>de</samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp>de_DE</samp>&rsquo; (German as spoken in
Germany), and &lsquo;<samp>pt</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>pt_PT</samp>&rsquo; (Portuguese as spoken in Portugal)
in this context.

<a name="Translating-Teams"></a>
<a name="SEC380"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC373">17.2.3 Translating Teams</a> </h3>

<p>For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list
of teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
&lsquo;<tt>https://translationproject.org/</tt>&rsquo;, in the &quot;Teams&quot; area.
</p>
<p>If you'd like to volunteer to <em>work</em> at translating messages, you
should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
The subscribing address is <em>not</em> the same as the list itself, it
has &lsquo;<samp>-request</samp>&rsquo; appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send
a message to &lsquo;<tt>sv-request@li.org</tt>&rsquo;, having this message body:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">subscribe
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
<em>actively</em> in translations, or at solving translational
difficulties, rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not
exist yet and you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to
do or how to get started, please write to
&lsquo;<tt>coordinator@translationproject.org</tt>&rsquo; to reach the
coordinator for all translator teams.
</p>
<p>The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised
more than programming skills, here.
</p>

<p>Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of visible
blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are used for
implementing regional variants of languages, or language dialects.
</p>
<p>For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to which
it applies should also have been internationalized and distributed as
such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable lag between the
mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a distribution.

<h3 class="subsection"> <a href="gettext_toc.html#TOC375">17.2.5 Using <code>gettext</code> in new packages</a> </h3>

<p>If you are writing a freely available program and want to internationalize
it you are welcome to use GNU &lsquo;<tt>gettext</tt>&rsquo; in your package.  Of course
you have to respect the GNU Lesser General Public License which covers
the use of the GNU &lsquo;<tt>gettext</tt>&rsquo; library.  This means in particular that
even non-free programs can use <code>libintl</code> as a shared library, whereas
only free software can use <code>libintl</code> as a static library or use
modified versions of <code>libintl</code>.
</p>
<p>Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle the
use of <code>gettext</code> the only thing missing are the translations.  The
Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
&lsquo;<tt>coordinator@translationproject.org</tt>&rsquo; to make the &lsquo;<tt>.pot</tt>&rsquo; files
available to the translation teams.
