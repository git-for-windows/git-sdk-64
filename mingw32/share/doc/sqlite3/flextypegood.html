<h1 id="introduction"><span>1. </span>Introduction</h1>

<p>SQLite provides developers with the freedom to store content in
any desired format, regardless of the declared datatype of the column.
Some people find this feature troublesome.  Some developers are shocked
to discover that it is possible to insert text into a column marked INTEGER.

</p><p>This article advocates in favor of the flexible type rules
in SQLite.

</p><h1 id="about_flexible_typing"><span>2. </span>About Flexible Typing</h1>

<p>Details regarding the flexible type system of SQLite are found
in the separate <a href="datatype3.html">Datatypes In SQLite</a> document.  Here is a quick
summary:

</p><ul>
<li><p> Datatype names on column definitions are optional.  A column definition
        can consist of just the column name and nothing else.
</p></li><li><p> When datatype names are provided, they can be just about any text.
        SQLite attempts to deduce the preferred datatype for the column based
        on the datatype name in the column definition, but that preferred
        datatype is advisory, not mandatory.  The preferred datatype is
        call the "column affinity".
</p></li><li><p> An attempt is made to transform incoming data into the preferred
        datatype of the column.  (All SQL database engines do this, not
        just SQLite.)  If this transformation is successful, all is well.
        But if unsuccessful, instead of raising an error, SQLite just stores
        the content using its original datatype.
</p></li><li><p> The above can lead to situations that advocates of rigid typing
        find incommodious:
        </p><center><table border="1" cellpadding="5">
        <tr><th>Column Datatype</th><th>Types Allowed In That Column
        </th></tr><tr><td>INTEGER</td><td>INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB
        </td></tr><tr><td>REAL</td><td>REAL, TEXT, BLOB
        </td></tr><tr><td>TEXT</td><td>TEXT, BLOB
        </td></tr><tr><td>BLOB</td><td>INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB
        </td></tr></table></center>
</li><li><p> Note that an INTEGER or REAL value will never end up being stored
        in a TEXT column, since an INTEGER or REAL value can and always will
        be converted into its equivalent TEXT representation.  Similarly,
        and INTEGER will never be stored in a REAL column because it will
        always be converted into a REAL.  But TEXT does not always look like
        and INTEGER or REAL value and so cannot always be converted.  And a
        BLOB cannot be converted into anything and nothing else can be
        converted into a BLOB.
</p></li></ul>


<h1 id="cases_where_flexible_typing_is_useful"><span>3. </span>Cases Where Flexible Typing Is Useful</h1>

<p>Some readers, upon first encountering flexible typing in SQLite, ask
themselves "how could this ever be useful?"  Here is an
attempt to answer that question:

</p><h2 id="attribute_tables"><span>3.1. </span>Attribute tables</h2>

<p> Many applications, especially those that use SQLite as an
<a href="appfileformat.html">application file format</a>, need a place to store miscellaneous attributes
such as thumbnail images (as BLOB values), short pieces of text (such
as the user's name), as well as numeric, date, and JSON values.  It is
convenient to create a single table to handle this storage:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>CREATE TABLE attribute(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value) WITHOUT ROWID;
</pre></div>

<p>Without flexible typing, such a table would need to be more complex,
with separate columns for each possible type of data.  Flexible typing
of the "value" column makes the table conceptually simpler, more
space-efficient, and easier to access and update.

</p><p>In the <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil version control system</a>, each
repository has a CONFIG table that is used to store all kinds of settings
with every possible datatype.  The user-specific configuration file
for Fossil (the ~/.fossil file) is a separate SQLite database that contains
a single attribute table hold the user-specific state across all
repositories.

</p><p> Some applications use an SQLite database as a pure key-value store
The database schema contains a single table that looks something like this:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>CREATE TABLE storage(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value ANYTHING);
</pre></div>

<h2 id="the_value_column_output_from_the_json_tree_virtual_tables"><span>3.2. </span>The "value" column output from the json_tree virtual tables</h2>

<p>The <a href="json1.html#jtree">json_tree</a> and <a href="json1.html#jeach">json_each</a> table-valued functions that are
built into SQLite both have a "value" column that can hold values of
type INTEGER, REAL, or TEXT depending on the type of the corresponding
JSON field.  For example:

</p><div class="codeblock"><pre>SELECT typeof(value) FROM json_each('{"a":1,"b":2.5,"c":"hello"}');
</pre></div>

<p>The query above returns three rows of one column with values
"integer", "real", and "text", respectively.

</p><h2 id="storage_for_dirty_data"><span>3.3. </span>Storage for dirty data</h2>

<p> Analysts sometimes encounter CSV files where some columns contain
a mixture of integer, real, and text data.  CSV file that are obtained
from Excel spreadsheet exports commonly have this trait, for example.
When importing such "dirty data" into an SQL database, it is convenient
to have flexible columns to import into.

</p><p> Dirty data is not restricted to CSV files coming out of Excel, of
course.  There are many data sources in which a single field might
contain a mix of types.  For example, a data column might the number
of seconds since 1970 sometimes, or as a text date string in other cases.
It is desirable to clean up these inconsistent representations,
but at the same time it is convenient to be able to store all the different
representations in the same column of the intermediate database while the
cleanup is underway.

</p><h2 id="dynamic_programming_languages"><span>3.4. </span>Dynamic programming languages</h2>

<p>SQLite began as a TCL extension that later escaped into the wild.
TCL is a dynamic language in the sense that the programmer does not need
to be aware of datatypes.  Under the hood, TCL keeps careful track of the
datatype of every value, but to the developer and user of a TCL program,
everything looks like a string.  Flexible typing is a natural fit for
use with dynamic programming languages like TCL and others, since with
a dynamic programming language, you can not always predict in advance what
datatype a variable will hold.  So when you need to store the value of that
variable into the database, having a database that is supports flexible
typing makes storage much easier.

</p><h2 id="data_typename_cross_compatibility"><span>3.5. </span>Data typename cross-compatibility</h2>

<p>Every SQL database engine seems to have its own unique set of supported
datatype names:

</p><ul>
<li> BIGINT
</li><li> UNSIGNED SMALL INT
</li><li> TEXT
</li><li> VARCHAR
</li><li> VARYING CHARACTER
</li><li> NATIONAL VARYING CHARACTER
</li><li> NVARCHAR
</li><li> JSON
</li><li> REAL
</li><li> FLOAT
</li><li> DOUBLE PRECISION
</li><li> <i> ... and so forth ...</i>
</li></ul>

<p>The fact that SQLite will accept any of these names as a valid typename,
and let you store any kind of content into the column, increases the chances
that a script written to run on some other SQL database engine will also
work in SQLite.

</p><h2 id="repurposing_unused_or_disused_columns_in_legacy_databases"><span>3.6. </span>Repurposing unused or disused columns in legacy databases</h2>

<p> Because an SQLite database file is a single file on disk, some
applications use SQLite as an <a href="appfileformat.html">application file format</a>.  This means
that a single instance of the application might, over the course of its
life, talk to hundreds or thousands of separate databases, each in a separate
file.  When such applications evolve over years, some columns in the
underlying database will have their meanings altered subtly.  Or, it might
be desirable to repurpose an existing column to serve two or more purposes.
This is much easier to do if the column has a flexible datatype.

</p><h1 id="perceived_disadvantages_of_flexible_typing_with_rebuttals_"><span>4. </span>Perceived Disadvantages of Flexible Typing (With Rebuttals)</h1>

<p> The following perceived disadvantages of flexible typing were
    gleaned and compiled from countless posts on Hacker News and
    Reddit and similar forums where developers discuss these sorts of
    things.  If you can think of other reasons why flexible typing
    is a bad idea, please contact the SQLite developers or leave a
    post on the <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forum">SQLite Forum</a> so
    that your idea can be added to the list.


</p><h2 id="we_ve_never_done_it_that_way_before"><span>4.1. </span>We've never done it that way before</h2>

<p> Many skeptics of flexible typing simply express
shock and disbelief, without offering any rationale for why they think
flexible typing is a bad idea.  Without supporting arguments, one must
assume their reason for not liking flexible typing is that it is different
from what they are used to.

</p><p> Presumably, many developers who are aghast at SQLite's flexible
typing feel this way because they have just never encountered anything
like it before.  All prior exposure to databases and especially SQL
databases has involved rigid typing, and the readers mental model of
SQL includes rigid typing as a fundamental feature.  Flexible typing
upsets their world-view.

</p><p> Yes, flexible typing is a new way of thinking about data in an
SQL database.  But new is not necessary bad.  Sometimes, and I think
especially in the case of flexible typing, innovation leads to improvement.

</p><h2 id="rigid_type_enforcement_helps_prevent_application_bugs"><span>4.2. </span>Rigid type enforcement helps prevent application bugs</h2>

<p> It has become a point of doctrine among many programmers that the
best way to prevent application bugs is strict type enforcement.  But I
find no evidence in support of this.

</p><p> To be sure, strict type enforcement does help prevent some kinds of
bugs in lower-level languages like C and C++ that present a model that is
close to machine hardware.  But this does not seem to
be the case for higher-abstraction languages in which all data is 
passed around in a "Value" superclass of some kind which is subclassed
for the various lower-level data types.  When everything is a Value
object, specific datatypes cease to be important.

</p><p> This technical note is being writing by the original author of SQLite.
I having been writing TCL programs for 27 years.  TCL has no type enforcement
whatsoever.  The "Value" class in TCL (called Tcl_Obj) can hold many
different datatypes, but it presents the content to the program and to
the application user as a string.  And I've had a lot of bugs in
those TCL programs over the years.  But I do not recall a single instance
where the bugs might have been caught by a rigid type system.  I have
also written a lot of C code over a span of 35 years, not the
least of which is SQLite itself.  I have found the type system in C
to be very helpful at finding and preventing problems.  For the
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil Version Control System</a>, which is written
in C, I have even implemented supplemental static analysis programs that
scan the Fossil source code prior to compilation, looking for problems
that compilers miss.  This works well for compiled programs.

</p><p> The SQL language model is a higher-level abstraction that C/C++.
In SQLite, every data item is stored in memory as an "sqlite3_value" object.
There are subclasses of this object for strings, integer, floating-point
numbers, blobs, and other representations.  Everything is passed around
inside the SQL language implemented by SQLite as "sqlite3_value" objects
so the underlying datatype does not really matter.  I have never found
rigid type enforcement to be helpful in languages like TCL and SQLite
that have a single "Value" superclass used to represent any data element.
Fossil makes extensive use of SQLite in its implementation.  There have
been many bugs in Fossil over its 14-years history, but I cannot recall
a single bug that might have been prevented by rigid type enforcement in
the SQLite.  C-language bugs might have been caught by better type enforcement
(which is why I wrote the supplemental source code scanners), but no
SQL bugs.

</p><p> Based on decades of experience, I reject the thesis that rigid
type enforcement helps prevent application bugs.  I will accept and
believe a slightly modified thesis:  Rigid type enforcement helps to
prevent applications bugs <em>in languages that lack a single
top-level "Value" superclass</em>.  But SQLite does have the
single "sqlite3_value" superclass, so that proverb does not apply.

</p><h2 id="rigid_type_enforcement_prevents_data_pollution"><span>4.3. </span>Rigid type enforcement prevents data pollution</h2>

<p> Some people contend that if you have rigorous constraints on the
schema, and especially strict enforcement of column datatypes, this
will help prevent incorrect data from being added to the database.
This is not true.  It is true that type enforcement might help prevent
<em>egregiously</em> incorrect data from getting into the system.
But type enforcement is no help in prevent subtly incorrect data
from being recorded.

</p><p> So, for example, rigid type enforcement can successfully prevent
the customer name (text) from being inserted into integer
Customer.creditScore column.  On the other hand, if that mistake occurs,
it is very easy to spot the problem and find all affected rows.
But type enforcement is no help in preventing a bug where the customer
family name and given name are reversed, since both are text fields.

</p><p> (Aside:  Decades ago, I worked on a team where there was a woman
named "Merritt Tracy".  "Merritt" was her given name and "Tracy" was
her family name.  She reported that she spend an inordinate amount of
time and energy trying to correct databases that had "Tracy" has her 
given name and "Merritt" as her family name.)

</p><p> By suppressing easy-to-detect errors and passing through only the
hard-to-detect errors, rigid type enforcement can actually make it more
difficult to find and fix bugs.  Data errors tend to cluster.  If you have
20 different data sources, most of the data errors will usually come
from just 2 or 3 of those sources.  The presence of egregious
errors (such as text in an integer column) is a convenient early warning
signal that something is amiss.  The source of the problem can be 
tracked quickly and extra scrutiny applied to the source of the
egregious errors, thus hopefully also fixing the subtle errors too.
When egregious errors are suppressed, you lose an important signal
that helps you to detect and fix the subtle errors.

</p><p> Data errors are inevitable.  They will happen regardless of how
much type checking is done.  Rigid type enforcement can catch only
a small subset of those cases - the most obvious cases.  It does
nothing to help find and fix the more subtle cases.  And, by suppressing
the signal of which data sources are problematic, it can sometimes
make the subtle errors more difficult to locate.

</p><h2 id="other_sql_database_engines_don_t_work_this_way"><span>4.4. </span>Other SQL database engines don't work this way</h2>

<p> Because SQLite is less restrictive and allows you to do more things,
SQL scripts that work on other database engines will also usually work
on SQLite, but script written initially for SQLite might not work
on more restrictive database engines.  This can cause problems when
developers user SQLite for prototyping and testing and then migrate their
application to a more restrictive SQL engine for deployment.  If the
application was (unintentionally) taking advantage of the flexible
typing available in SQLite, then it will fail when migrated.

</p><p> People use this problem to argue that SQLite should be more
restrictive about datatypes.  But you could just as easily turn
that argument around and say that other database engines should be
more flexible with regard to datatypes.  The application was working
correctly under SQLite, prior to be migrated, after all.  If rigid
type enforcement is really all that useful, why did it break an
application that was previously working?

</p><h1 id="if_you_insist_on_rigid_type_enforcement_"><span>5. </span>If You Insist On Rigid Type Enforcement...</h1>

<p>As of SQLite version 3.37.0 (2021-11-27), SQLite supports this
development style using <a href="stricttables.html">STRICT tables</a>.

</p><p>If you find a real-world case where STRICT tables prevented or
would have prevented a bug in an application, please post a message to the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forum">SQLite Forum</a> so that we can add your story
to this document.

</p><h1 id="embrace_freedom"><span>6. </span>Embrace Freedom</h1>

<p>If flexible typing in an SQL database is a new concept to you,
I encourage you to give it a try.  It probably will not cause you
any problems and it might make your program simpler and easier to
write and maintain.  I think that even if you are skeptical at first,
if you will just give flexible typing a try, you will eventually
come to realize that it is a better approach and will start
encouraging other database vendors to support at least an ANY
datatype if not complete SQLite-style type flexibility.

</p><p>Most of the time, flexible typing does not matter because a column
stores a single well-defined type.  But occasionally you will run
across situations where having a flexible type system makes the
solution to your problem cleaner and easier.
