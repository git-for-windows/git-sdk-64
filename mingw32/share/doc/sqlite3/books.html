<h2>SQLite Forensics (2018)</h2>

<p>
Author: Paul Sanderson<br>
Publisher: <a href='https://www.amazon.com/SQLite-Forensics-Paul-Sanderson/dp/1980293074'>Amazon</a>

<p>
This text by noted digital forensics expert, Paul Sanderson, provides
investigators with low-level technical details useful in analysing
SQLite database files.

<p>
Every computer and phone uses hundreds of SQLite databases and there are
over one trillion SQLite databases in active use. Hence, the importance
of examining the data held in these databases in an
investigation, including deleted data when possible, is paramount. This
book fully explains the format of the SQLite database file. It shows how
records are encoded, how to decode them manually and how to decode
records that are partially overwritten. It also describe how the
workings of SQLite, and in particular the journal and WAL, can be used
to ascertain what has happened in a manner that cannot be determined
from the data alone. The book covers basic SQL queries and how they can
be used to create a custom report that includes data from different
tables, and shows how one can use SQL queries to test hypotheses about
the relationships of data in different tables. 
<p>
This book is aimed mainly at
forensic practitioners, and it is assumed that the reader has some basic
knowledge of computer forensics; it will also be of interest to computer
professionals in general particularly those who have an interest in the
SQLite file format.

<p>
Outside of the world of enterprise computing, there is one database 
that enables a huge range of software and hardware to flex relational 
database capabilities, without the baggage and cost of traditional 
database management systems. That database is SQLite - an embeddable
database with an amazingly small footprint, yet able to handle databases 
of enormous size. SQLite comes equipped with an array of powerful 
features available through a host of programming and development 
environments. It is supported by languages such as C, Java, Perl,
PHP, Python, Ruby, TCL, and more.</p>

<p><i>The Definitive Guide to SQLite, Second Edition</i> 
is devoted to complete coverage of the latest version of this powerful 
database. It offers a thorough overview of SQLite's capabilities 
and APIs. The book also uses SQLite as the basis for helping newcomers
make their first foray into database development. In only a short time 
you can be writing programs as diverse as a server-side browser plug-in 
or the next great iPhone or Android application!

<h2>Using SQLite (2010)</h2>

Author: Jay A. Kreibich<br>
Publisher: O'Reilly Media<br>
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596521196/">O'Reilly</a></p>

<p>Developers, take note: databases aren't just for the IS group any more.
You can build database-backed applications for the desktop, Web,
embedded systems, or operating systems without linking to heavy-duty
client-server databases such as Oracle and MySQL. 
This book shows how you to use SQLite, a small and lightweight 
database that you can build right into your application during development.
Applications that handle data have an enormous advantage today, and
with SQLite, you'll discover how to develop a database-backed application
that remains manageable in size and complexity. This book guides
you every step of the way. You'll get a crash course in data modeling, 
become familiar with SQLite's dialect of the SQL database language, 
and learn how you to work with SQLite using either a scripting 
language or a C-based language, such as C# or Objective C.Now, 
even relatively small and nimble applications can be a part of 
the data revolution. Using SQLite shows you how.

<p>Die Datenbanksprache SQL ( Structured Query Language ) wird in Datenbanken
zur Definition, Manipulation, Sicherung, aber hauptsaechlich zur Abfrage 
von Daten aus der Datenbank eingesetzt. Unabhaengig vom Betriebssystem oder 
aufwendigen, benutzerfreundlichen, graphischen Oberflaechen bleibt die 
Logik aber immer gleich.SQLite ist eine freie Desktop-Datenbank, 
sie kostet nichts, ist fuer viele Betriebssysteme verfuegbar, 
schnell heruntergeladen und installiert und auf das Notwendigste 
reduziert. Fuer den Einsteiger sind das die besten Voraussetzungen, 
ohne viel Aufwand schnell in die Welt der Datenbanken und Datenbanksprache 
reinzuschnuppern.Wer nach den Uebungen aber auf den Geschmack gekommen ist,
hat schon den groessten Teil an Datenbanken und SQL gelernt, denn alles 
Besprochene ist Wissen, welches auch auf jedes andere der vielen 
Datenbanken grundlegend anwendbar ist. Nun koennen Sie auf die richtig 
Grossen zugehen, vom grossen Fachbuch bis zum riesigen Datenbanksystem.

<p>SQLite is a small, zero-configuration, custom-tailored, embeddable, 
thread-safe, easily maintainable, transaction-oriented, SQL-based,
relational database management system. There is no separate install or 
setup procedure to initialize SQLite before using it. 
There is no configuration file. 
SQLite is open source, and is available in the public domain 
(for more information on open source, visit http://opensource.org). 
You can download SQLite source code from its homepage http://www.sqlite.org, 
compile it using your favorite C compiler, and start using the compiled
library. SQLite runs on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and a few other operating systems. It has been widely used in low-to-medium tier database applications. 
This Short Cut discusses design principles, engineering trade-offs, 
implementation issues, and operations of SQLite. It presents a 
comprehensive description of all important components of the SQLite engine.</p>

<p>
SQLite is a small, fast, embeddable database. What makes it popular is 
the combination of the database engine and interface into a single library 
as well as the ability to store all the data in a single file.
Its functionality lies between MySQL and PostgreSQL, however it is faster 
than both databases.</p>

<p>In <i>SQLite</i>, 
author Chris Newman provides a thorough, practical guide to 
using, administering and programming this up-and-coming database. 
If you want to learn about SQLite or about its use in conjunction with 
PHP this is the book for you.</p>
