.SH NAME
gnutls_record_set_max_size \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_set_max_size(gnutls_session_t " session ", size_t " size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "size_t size" 12
is the new size
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the maximum record packet size in this
connection.

The requested record size does get in effect immediately only while
sending data. The receive part will take effect after a successful
handshake.

Prior to 3.6.4, this function was implemented using a TLS extension
called 'max record size', which limits the acceptable values to
512(=2^9), 1024(=2^10), 2048(=2^11) and 4096(=2^12). Since 3.6.4,
it uses another TLS extension called 'record size limit', which
doesn't have the limitation, as long as the value ranges between
512 and 16384.  Note that not all TLS implementations use or even
understand those extension.

In TLS 1.3, the value is the length of plaintext content plus its
padding, excluding content type octet.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
