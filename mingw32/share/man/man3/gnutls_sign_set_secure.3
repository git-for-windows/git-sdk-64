.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_sign_set_secure(gnutls_sign_algorithm_t " sign ", unsigned int " secure ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign" 12
the sign algorithm
.IP "unsigned int secure" 12
whether to mark the sign algorithm secure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  \fIsign\fP as secure
or insecure.  This only has effect when the algorithm is marked as
secure through the allowlisting mode in the configuration file, or
when the setting is modified with a prior call to this function.

Even when  \fIsecure\fP is true,  \fIsign\fP is not marked as secure for the
use in certificates.  Use \fBgnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs()\fP to
mark it secure as well for certificates.
